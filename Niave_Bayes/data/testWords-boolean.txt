is
the
best
super
wise
and
hilarious
prof
knows
a
lot
about
historical
cultures
his
class
an
attainable
if
you
just
fill
out
study
guide
for
finals
midterms
almost
no
hw
he
teaches
based
on
what
wants
us
to
know
rather
than
we
don't
that
makes
sense
rambles
sometimes
take
him
-----
professor
barna
if
anything
is
an
amazing
although
he
does
tend
to
go
off
on
tangents
at
times
it's
not
a
bad
thing
me
his
make
lectures
more
interesting
entertaining
and
in
my
opinion
efficient
unique
distinct
perspective
the
books
we
read
only
further
previous
statement
take
class
-----
nyu
liberal
studies
is
a
huge
waste
of
money
and
professors
like
barna
prove
just
why
every
class
he
goes
off
on
random
tangents
talking
about
god
knows
what
then
when
it
hits
finals
midterms
decides
to
cram
all
the
info
that
shouldve
been
teaching
entire
time
clown
professor
so
if
you
want
tuition
hes
great
-----
john
barna's
class
is
an
absolute
joke
he
goes
off
topic
for
most
of
the
period
repeats
himself
every
single
lesson
and
fills
rest
his
with
useless
junk
do
yourself
a
favor
don't
waste
your
tuition
on
taking
this
man's
-----
professor
barna
is
a
funny
person
who
enjoys
talking
about
his
fencing
team
if
you
are
not
fan
of
cf
and
want
to
get
good
grade
consider
taking
class
-----
do
yourself
a
favor
don't
take
professor
barna
it
is
solid
waste
of
your
tuition
he
only
cares
about
his
sports
teams
which
you
should
join
if
are
stuck
in
class
never
really
teaches
anything
and
tests
at
least
three
times
as
long
any
other
cf
test
literally
took
me
just
under
4
hours

if
you
play
sports
and
join
his
intramural
team
are
guaranteed
an

back+paper
for
those
who
sport

has
extra
class
which
will
influence
your
grade
his
study
guide

horribly
tough
though

he's
caring
very
lenient
with
deadlines
he
gives
you
a
study
guide
for
the
exam
questions
related
to
class
is
relaxed
don't
need
participate
and
talks

great
professor
talks
a
lot
in
class
does
not
care
if
you
listen
or
one
of
the
best

-----
definitely
taking
barna
again
very
understanding
if
you
ever
needed
an
extension
or
missed
a
class
for
something
important
were
late
and
spoke
to
him
after
about
it
he'd
usually
just
mark
as
present
he
gave
study
guides
that
could
be
filled
out
used
on
midterm
final
which
easy
but
long
no
one
really
read
-----
barna
is
the
best
professor
at
nyu
easiest
a
and
great
class
to
catch
up
on
your
sleep
take
him
-----
barna's
a
legend
-
take
him
play
for
his
intramural
team
talk
to
about
sportsa
lectures
are
quite
useless
so
use
them
as
study
hall
midterm
and
finals
long
but
you
get
guide
nothing
else
comes
in
fact
u
can
even
meet
outside
class
he'll
help
fill
the
whole
he's
easiest
professor
at
nyu
-----
barna
is
the
easiest
a
you'll
ever
recieve
sweet
guy
and
means
well
but
if
you
actually
want
to
learn
something
do
not
take
him
also
trying
stay
awake
during
his
lectures
proves
incredibly
difficult
-----
living
legend
show
up
to
class
fill
out
the
study
guides
that
you
get
use
on
exams
and
will
an
a
he's
easiest
teacher
at
nyu
-----
he
is
genuinely
very
kind
rambles
off
topic
a
lot;
read
and
teach
yourself
be
up
to
date
with
bookshe
lenient
on
work
i
turned
in
everything
the
last
day
of
class
literally
just
go
do
not
skip
talk
him
time
you
will
probably
get
an
a-
if
discuss
anything
he'll
love
-----
he
is
truly
an
old
fashioned
professor
if
you
take
him
prepare
to
have
2
very
long
midterms
but
gives
them
beforehand
and
lets
with
the
test
definitely
do
not
wait
last
night
fill
out
will
be
more
than
ok
i
love
jb
can
manage
your
time
as
well
-----
i
thought
would
be
able
to
sit
through
his
long
boring
useless
and
off-topic
lectures
all
semester
for
the
easy
a
but
was
terribly
mistaken
did
not
learn
single
useful
thing
top
it
off
he
expects
you
attend
extra
classes
outside
of
normal
class
schedule
at
end
year
because
disorganization
-----
professor
barna
is
a
nice
guy
who
passionate
about
classic
literature
his
lectures
can
get
so
far
off
topic
however
that
sometimes
it
feels
as
though
he's
really
rushing
through
material
he
spent
the
first
two
classes
of
semester
telling
us
how
different
from
every
other
at
nyu
which
what
thinks
-----
such
a
nice
guy
very
clear
on
his
expectations
and
fair
grader
he
is
always
willing
to
help
will
make
sure
you
understand
all
material
before
midterm
or
final
interesting
lectures
great
professor
overall
highly
recommended
-----
a
legend
one
of
my
favorite
professors
at
nyu
so
far
i
took
him
for
sf1
and
sf2
&
may
take
again
sf3
unfortunately
he
did
have
health
problems
last
semester
but
that
is
out
his
control
managed
to
get
good
grade
anyway
think
you
really
only
need
do
the
reading
work
hard
on
essays
will
be
fine
-----
there
is
essentially
no
clear
grading
criteria
so
unless
you
know
the
way
he
grades
get
ready
to
be
screwed
over
a
nice
guy
but
will
not
compromise
on
anything
during
our
class
was
out
for
almost
half
semester
due
health
problems
which
of
his
control
course
expected
us
do
all
work
without
teaching
-----
portanova
is
a
quirky
nice
professor
who
makes
for
an
enjoyable
class
he
sometimes
goes
on
tangents
but
always
sure
the
material
needed
taught
readings
can
be
bit
heavy
if
you
participate
or
ask
q
once
every
will
fine
midterms
and
finals
are
easy
as
long
paid
attention
him
about
his
dachshund
-----
portanova
is
a
great
professor
he
very
lecture
heavy
and
yes
will
go
on
tangents
but
it's
obvious
that
because
he's
passionate
about
what
teaching
accessible
outside
of
class
gives
feedback
during
office
hours
just
make
point
to
comment
ask
questions
does
grade
participation
-----
portanova
can
be
a
great
guy
but
most
of
his
lectures
were
irrelevant
and
he
would
often
go
off
on
tangents
wanted
students
to
participate
for
grade
never
opened
the
class
discussions
whenever
did
talk
down
them
prove
had
more
knowledge
subject
-----
do
the
reading
if
you
very
clearly
listed
readings
and
take
okay
notes
than
you're
solid
for
his
class
because
he
pretty
much
goes
over
in
more
detail
sf1
there
are
2
essays
easy
midterm
final
lectures
mostly
but
adds
humor
ever
so
often
it's
not
that
hard
to
well
-----
it
was
hard
to
keep
up
with
his
course
but
he
is
a
great
person
-----
portanova
is
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
had
at
nyu
you
definitely
have
to
do
readings
before
class
but
it
makes
lectures
engaging
he
also
picks
really
interesting
literature
for
that
covers
more
than
just
white
european
authors
his
exams
are
straightforward
he's
a
tough
grader
on
papers
-
office
hours
helpful
-----
you
have
to
put
the
time
into
this
class
do
readings
take
notes
listen
well
in
lectures
portanova
is
a
fantastic
lecturer
-
so
much
knowledge
share
and
fun
stories
thrown
for
effect
it's
hard
but
rewarding
when
effort
lots
of
reading
he
expects
participate
speaking
it
-----
professor
portanova
is
incredibly
intelligent
and
knowledgable
his
lectures
are
very
interesting
he
has
a
sweet
quirky
sense
of
humor
always
at
least
10
mins
late
but
gives
straightforward
reading
paper
assignments
ask
him
about
dachshund
-----
joseph
is
my
favorite
teacher
at
nyu
his
lectures
are
hysterical
and
incredibly
interesting
make
sure
to
go
class
because
he
bases
exams
on
content
of
discussions
but
they're
really
not
hard
if
you
do
the
reviews
office
hours
also
helped
in
two
papers
assigns
he's
a
very
fair
grader
all
phenomenal
human
-----
he
knows
literally
everything
about
the
material
very
knowledgable
but
his
reading
expectations
are
wild
never
cancels
class
will
likely
be
10-20
minutes
late
every
single
day
midterms
finals
aren't
hard
only
3
questions
so
really
need
to
thoroughly
study
2
texts
for
each
exam
don't
waste
your
time
studying
-----
honestly
i
was
surprised
by
the
class
quality
based
on
these
comments
boring
lectures
talks
over
you
always
late
completely
arbitrary
grading
system
that
he
almost
refused
to
explain
sweet
guy
but
not
a
great
professor
-----
showed
up
late
to
class
7
out
of
10
times
and
would
start
15
minutes
he
grades
for
participation
but
doesn't
ask
a
lot
questions
tried
participate
spoke
over
me
goes
on
tangents
can't
be
sure
what
write
down
-----
i
took
him
for
both
sfi
and
sfii
it
was
a
blast
he
is
knowledgeable
loves
participation
if
you
do
the
readings
listen
to
lectures
will
fine
expects
lot
in
essays
but
exams
are
definitely
doable
he's
hilarious
just
an
adorable
human
being
10
would
take
again
wanted
his
classes
fill
up
so
quickly
-----
my
friend
and
i
used
to
refer
him
as
king
joseph
the
reasonable
if
he
gives
you
a
bad
grade
it's
totally
fair
doesn't
expect
anything
insane
from
in
order
get
an
can
be
surprisingly
funny
charming
his
map-making
skills
are
super
memorable
-----
great
professor
signed
swifty
morgan
-----
i
love
portanova
he
expects
a
certain
amount
of
dedication
and
effort
from
his
students
but
altogether
he's
not
particularly
hard
grader
read
the
assigned
hw
you'll
do
just
fine
in
class
probably
on
midterm
final
too
lectures
were
interesting
man
is
so
knowledgeable
told
fun
stories
them
also
field
trips
-----
portanova
really
cares
about
the
material
he
teaches
very
prepared
for
class
and
there
a
wide
variety
of
materials
used:
literature
poetry
art
photography
film--you
name
it
makes
exciting
with
his
jokes
whiteboard
drawings
also
engaging
helpful
during
office
hours
excellent
professor
assignments
are
interesting
too
-----
professor
portanova
is
really
knowledgeable
and
passionate
about
the
areas
he
teaches
but
can
be
unclear
on
grading
criteria
definitely
do
assigned
readings
there's
a
lot
answer
discussion
questions
before
class
helps
you
understand
material
better
-----
terrible
professor
with
even
worse
grading
the
course
allows
for
no
improvement
if
there's
a
drastic
change
in
writing
extremely
boring
lectures
some
expecting
you
to
read
whole
book
between
classes
worst
i've
had
at
nyu
-----
incredibly
boring
lectures
complete
with
zero
student
interaction
and
unclear
grading
uses
very
obscure
scale
nearly
all
of
the
midterm
final
was
definitions
seems
kind
but
is
ruthless
when
it
comes
to
i
would
definitely
recommend
that
you
at
costs
do
not
take
this
class
your
choice
-
choose
wisely
-----
horribly
monotonous
and
boring--no
clear
grading
criteria
whatsoever
an
extremely
closed-minded
professor
who
will
branch
off
into
pop
culture
tangents
constantly
expects
you
to
memorize
passages
lengthy
definitions
verbatim
for
the
midterm
final
would
rather
switch
majors
than
take
this
class
again
-----
her
grading
expectations
are
unclear
for
the
midterms
and
finals
you
better
memorize
everything
to
t
or
it's
over
:
not
very
open-minded
other
ways
of
thinking
but
own
worst
professor
i
have
ever
had
would
recommend
taking
only
took
because
no
one
else
was
available
good
luck
you'll
need
it
-----
her
midterm
did
not
make
sense
and
she
would
take
points
off
for
things
if
you
do
it
exactly
as
wanted
open
to
different
ideas
ways
of
thinking
other
than
own
examples
good
writing
are
subpar
use
class
notes
tells
penalizes
but
then
its
like
why
am
i
coming
-----
she
clearly
cares
about
the
subject
which
is
only
positive
i
saw
with
her
never
do
reviews
on
this
but
was
so
bad
felt
had
an
obligation
expects
yuo
to
follow
guidelines
for
writing
essays
deviate
in
slightest
and
you
earn
yourself
f
would
sound
fine
if
weren't
ridiculous
-----
pamela
brown
is
a
very
disengaging
professor
not
only
does
she
lecture
in
monotonous
tone
but
her
expectations
are
also
ridiculous
holds
high
standard
for
your
assignments
and
if
you
deviate
slightly
from
guidelines
will
be
marked
down
-----
horrible
teacher
every
class
is
identical
she
gets
in
front
of
the
and
just
reads
book
i
didn't
learn
anything
this
was
constantly
frustrated
with
how
much
a
waste
time
also
grades
on
whether
likes
you
or
not
her
midterm
final
are
required
to
memorize
word
for
paragraphs
-----
ridiculous
you
will
put
the
most
effort
into
this
class
to
get
worst
grade
-----
number
one
piece
of
advice
for
this
class
is
to
ask
help
she's
super
happy
tell
you
what
she
wants
and
will
let
know
if
you're
on
the
right
track
her
desired
writing
style
hard
get
used
can
be
a
tough
grader
but
try
do
pretty
well
lectures
are
info
heavy
very
interesting
-----
tests
are
based
on
very
specific
parts
of
the
lecture
make
sure
to
study
definitions
ahead
time
-----
i
struggled
to
stay
awake
every
single
class
and
wasn't
the
only
one
students
barely
understood
what
she
was
teaching
work
too
bad
if
you
pay
attention
but
that's
hard
part
didn't
understand
that
we
aren't
advanced
philosophy
are
you'll
do
well
were
just
taking
this
because
it
required
-----
prof
brown
was
the
best
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
she
really
cares
about
her
students
and
is
very
helpful
in
everything
lectures
are
amazing
knowledgeable
when
compared
to
other
profs
taken
who
just
waste
time
class
doing
meaningless
discussions
actually
teaches
a
lot
take
if
you
want
learn
-----
professor
brown
is
one
of
the
most
boring
professors
i've
had
so
far
her
lectures
drag
on
also
topics
for
essays
are
insanely
intricate
and
require
you
to
read
prompt
at
least
15
times
even
get
some
kind
understanding
what
its
asking
that
being
said
exams
easy
she
gives
pretty
much
entire
test
beforehand
-----
worst
prof
i've
ever
had
-----
a
very
intelligent
professor
but
has
no
room
for
others'
opinions
which
makes
her
appear
stuck
up
and
condescending
the
material
is
fairly
easy
prof
brown
manages
to
complicate
it
deliberately
students
believe
that
class
hard
their
low
grades
are
fair
an
acceptable
doesn't
suit
nyu
at
all
-----
professor
brown
is
amazing
she's
tough
but
that
really
motivated
me
to
do
my
best
in
her
class
i
can
say
of
all
professors
this
semester
got
the
most
out
she
wants
for
students
especially
when
it
comes
writing
definitely
not
a
you
easily
bs
an
doable
will
take
hard
work
-----
literally
the
worst
professor
i've
ever
had
she
is
entirely
uninspirational
and
boring
get
ready
to
memorize
entire
paragraphs
write
dullest
most
obvious
essays
possible
i
love
reading
writing
even
for
me
made
every
book
completely
tiresome
do
not
take
her
please
will
ruin
good
literature
you
-----
she
is
an
extremely
tough
grader
and
her
expectations
of
good
writing
were
very
hard
for
me
to
understand
carry
out
in
my
essays
pretty
arrogant
when
talks
you
firm
own
beliefs
not
open
other
weekly
blogs
count
towards
participation
absolutely
avoid
if
want
easy
class
-----
she
is
a
very
intelligent
woman
who
knows
her
stuff
and
succeeds
in
making
everything
clear
for
students
to
understand
but
one
of
the
harshest
graders
i've
ever
had
20
verbatim
paragraph-long
definitions
required
midterm
final
only
worth
15%
whole
test
kills
us
on
grading
essays
idea
good
writing
ridiculou
-----
prof
tucker
is
the
best
he
an
amazing
lecturer
and
clearly
very
excited
passionate
about
politics
gives
outline
of
every
lecture
in
advance
so
you
know
what
key
topics
will
be
touched
on
i
cannot
stress
enough
how
great
your
grade
really
up
to
tas
but
they
were
graded
objectively
-----
go
to
lectures
there
is
no
textbook
so
what
he
says
in
class
constitutes
most
of
the
exams
his
are
well-organized
and
super
informational
that
little
time
for
questions
chats
allowed
though
not
accessible
outside
i'm
fortunate
i
met
a

ta
reading
isn't

-----
excellent
lecturer
one
of
the
best
at
nyu
course
well-organized
never
any
surprises
tucker
always
explains
objectives
&
structure
each
lesson
is
clear
direct

you
should
go

-----
i
absolutely
love
professor
tucker
he
basically
covers
the
material
in
readings
during
class
so
are
more
to
further
your
understanding
don't
think
it's
a
lot
of
reading
manageable
he's
an
amazing
lecturer
makes
everything
very
clear
and
clearly
passionate
knowledgeable
definitely
recommend
taking
his
-----
incredible
and
likable
professor
who
gives
very
engaging
lectures
there
is
a
lot
of
reading
which
can
help
further
your
knowledge
in
the
course
but
its
not
necessarily
necessary
to
do
well
class
as
long
you
take
great
lecture
notes
have
good
recitation
love
highly
recommend
-----
i
love
him
he's
a
passionate
respected
acclaimed
handsome
genius
and
the
best
lecturer
only
reason
to
not
take
is
if
you
hate
learning
superfluous
amounts
of
reading
but
impossible
with
good
time
management
&
they
align
lectures
attend
listen
lecture
since
he
speaks
writes
advanced
material
hard
course
-----
overall
great
professor
with
engaging
lecture
the
readings
are
painful
sometimes
and
ignore
them
if
you
have
to
since
they
only
worth
a
few
marks
on
tests
focus
attend
all
lectures
ask
questions
in
recitations
make
comprehensive
study
guides
for
will
do
-----
way
too
many
readings
and
they're
all
heavily
important
but
not
explicitly
discussed
dissected
he
seems
uncomfortable
teaching
in
front
of
a
classroom
has
illegible
handwriting
his
notes
often
are
one
worded
more
dependent
on
the
verbal
content
lot
information
no
concise
outline
or
takeaways
for
each
topic
-----
his
lectures
are
amazing
and
the
amount
of
reading
has
been
reduced
honestly
you
don't
have
to
do
readings
but
go
lecture
because
he
breaks
down
all
concepts
really
well
learned
a
lot
grading
is
entirely
dependent
on
your
tas
i
find
be
pretty
harsh
still
think
class
worth
it
-----
very
good
professor
lectures
are
really
-
he's
super
knowledge
and
funny
too
horrible
handwriting
tho
just
go
to
lecture
+
recitation
a
bit
of
studying
you'll
be
fine
-----
tough
grader
i
had
the
worst
ta
which
really
ruined
my
experience
-----
the
class
is
reading
intensive;
tons
of
readings
each
week
and
are
responsible
for
in
both
recitation
exams
paper
tas
determine
your
grade
understand
what
they
look
to
get
an
a
my
dropped
from
b+
because
just
one
essay
answer
on
final
ta
did
not
like
take
with
caution
-----
a
really
great
class
and
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
had
is
difficult
with
lot
reading
large
focus
on
eastern
europe
taught
like
second
year
course
high
expectations
tough
grading
do
most
to
all
required
attend
lecture
well
-----
professor
tucker
is
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
ever
had
you
listen
to
lectures
and
do
some
supplemental
reading
will
get
an
a
by
far
most
interesting
politics
class
taken
highly
recommend
-----
i
love
josh
he's
amazing
and
cares
so
much
about
what
he
does
grades
hard
but
really
is
available
if
you
need
help
his
lectures
are
engaging
recitation
sucks
can
do
-----
spoke
way
too
quickly
and
often
confused
the
class
by
repeating
same
thing
so
many
times--not
as
if
he
wanted
to
give
us
different
ways
of
understanding
a
concept
but
hadn't
prepared
best
articulate
his
thoughts
before
lecture
always
5-10
minutes
late
first
10
lectures
were
great
grading
was
very
fair
-----
jt
was
an
excellent
lecturer
makes
complicated
topics
more
simple
he
is
very
helpful
outside
of
class
as
well
there
however
a
lot
reading
make
sure
to
go
the
lecture
most
material
if
not
all
important
for
final
i
personally
did
do
single
they
were
way
too
long
wordy
etc
but
pretty
ok
-----
this
man
is
so
interesting
i
could
listen
to
him
talk
all
day
but
in
the
end
workload
was
too
much
for
me
had
drop
class
i'd
say
it
would
be
a
great
take
pass
fail
there
lot
of
work
involved
he
very
unapologetic
about
amount
he's
professor
-----
yes
he
is
a
very
smart
professor
simplifies
the
readings
well
but
too
much
to
point
it
not
doable
also
easy
get
b
an
you
have
be
extremely
close
with
your
ta
because
they
so
power
over
grades
one
thing
con
that
active
part
in
giving
-----
he
is
honestly
one
of
the
best
professors
ive
had
his
lectures
are
very
engaging
and
interesting
clear
in
terms
grading
criteria
if
you
do
readings
study
for
exam
it
not
a
hard
class
he's
helpful
approachable
-----
this
course
needs
no
homework
tests
all
you
need
to
do
receive
an
easy
a
is
write
good
30-page
journal
about
your
experience
during
the
semester
i
say
lot
of
students
dislike
ollman
just
because
they
not
understand
lecture
believe
me
listen
his
lectures
carefully
and
read
some
books
you'll
love
him
-----
great
intro
to
socialism
if
it's
something
ur
interested
in
ppl
get
offended
when
he
doesn't
take
their
very
tired
criticisms
seriously
but
don't
that
he's
studied
the
stuff
for
60
years
n
a
college
freshman
worry
about
missing
lectures
too
much
just
make
up
with
readings
work
on
your
journal
weekly
and
you'll
ace
funny
guy
-----
his
lecturers
are
unorganized
the
class
had
no
syllabus
you
have
to
get
10
books
but
he
doesnt
give
clear
directions
on
when
read
them
whole
is
based
a
journal
where
basically
pretend
be
marxist
in
order
an
if
show
put
effort
into
your
you'll
probably
he's
all
about
ur
opinions
-----
i
honestly
don't
think
ollman
grades
based
on
political
belief
at
all
my
journal
was
probably
more
leaning
the
conservative
side
than
most
but
still
ended
up
with
an
a
you
just
have
to
be
clear
your
arguments
and
not
procrastinate
until
very
last
few
days
do
this
20-30
page
really
interesting
guy
-----
the
negative
review
on
here
sort
of
make
me
sad
i
mean
definitely
get
criticisms
people
have
him
but
personally
really
enjoyed
his
class
he's
this
delightful
socialist
dude
who's
accommodating
to
student
issues
lectures
are
hard
follow
though
they
still
very
interesting
-----
professor
ollman
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
professors
that
i've
had
at
nyu
i
believe
his
books
are
rather
well
read
in
world
marxist
or
dialectical
works
main
coursework
from
which
really
analyzes
marx's
concepts
and
connects
them
to
current
events
class
do
readings
work
on
journal
weekly
:
-----
absolutely
horrible
professor
just
do
not
take
him
if
you
want
a
meaningful
experience
-----
worst
professor
i
have
ever
had
repeated
the
same
vague
statements
every
class;
would
forget
what
readings
he
assigned;
doesn't
engage
students
or
learn
students'
names
avoid
even
if
you
are
incredibly
interested
in
marxism
as
am
since
most
of
reading
is
just
ollman's
theory--a
quack
elliptical
pseudo-philosophy
a
disgrace
to
dept
-----
this
was
an
amazing
class
if
you
do
the
readings
he
puts
on
his
syllabus
can
write
a
great
journal
to
get
dont
be
shy
reach
out
for
help
are
confused
about
your
grade
he'll
happy
meet
with
and
discuss
potentially
amend
it
life
changing
opened
my
eyes
horrors
of
capitalist
society
who
is
john
galt
-----
i'm
very
interested
in
marxist
theory
and
i
was
having
trouble
staying
awake
during
lectures
don't
think
he
plans
class
at
all
just
walks
talks
for
an
hour
bother
asking
him
a
question
or
attempting
to
disagree
with
he'll
flat
out
ignore
you
disappointed
-----
as
a
poly
student
course
was
convenient
in
satisfying
humanities
requirement
not
writing
intensive
only
30-50
pg
journal
about
your
thoughts
reactions
and
summaries
of
lectures
due
at
the
end
semester
gives
you
freedom
to
choose
either
begin
beginning
or
later
on
easy
alright
prof
-----
people
are
too
harsh
on
him
good
course;
the
only
assignment
is
a
journal
which
everybody
puts
off
until
last
minute
come
in
with
an
open
mind
show
up
to
every
lecture
do
readings
and
you'll
learn
lot
it
also
would
have
been
nice
if
he
tie
material
current
events
real
life
-
more
cool
like
that
-----
this
guy
man
he
was
an
awful
teacher
easy
class
if
you
don't
want
to
do
anything
and
procrastinate
till
the
very
end
-----
i'm
very
interested
in
socialist
marxist
theory
but
i
wish
he
took
a
more
modern
approach
on
it
did
not
encourage
discussion
at
all
and
whenever
someone
would
ask
question
about
what
was
saying
often
dismissed
them
can
tell
he's
knowledgeable
some
of
says
seems
60s
his
lectures
are
hard
to
pay
attention
-----
lectures
are
repetitive
and
i
find
myself
not
going
to
class
often
because
he
says
the
same
things
no
tests
or
essays
whatsoever
just
a
40
pg
journal
due
at
end
of
semester
wants
you
read
4
books
on
socialism
doesn't
believe
in
grades
hard-core
marxist
take
this
course
super
easy
material
is
interesting
-----
i
took
him
for
socialist
theory
i'm
interested
in
the
subject
but
didn't
find
to
be
a
great
lecturer
books
he
published
were
clearer
than
his
lectures
which
helped
with
40
page
journal
due
at
end
of
course
only
assignment
-----
professor
ollman
is
1
of
a
kind
if
you
do
not
get
distracted
easily
and
can
focus
100%
without
drifting
for
75min
will
be
fine
listen
to

from

learn
more
than
most
other

off
40

with
him
still
an
i

but

-----
i
would
not
recommend
this
class
because
the
entire
grade
is
a
40
page
journal
that
details
your
journey
through
socialism
problem
there
no
rubric
and
way
to
check
progress
so
you
don't
have
any
clue
what
will
be
he
hates
grades
it
shows
-----
terrible
-----
one
of
the
biggest
morons
i
had
in
college
he
basically
blackmailed
class
into
engaging
extra-curricular
activities
that
were
important
to
him
and
his
socialist
buddies
by
threatening
not
give
everyone
an
a
frequently
late
never
prepared

if
you
can
call
it

real
jackass
-----
be
ready
to
teach
yourself
homework
require
you
do
work
based
on
the
chapter
that
is
covered
in
lecture
after
due
date
which
makes
it
kind

pointless

but
forces

if
you
are

student
should
definitely
take
his

super
interesting
and
inspiring
so
that
won't
be

by
other
things

to
work
hard
for
midterms
final
cuz
it
is
not
easy
predict
what

done
your
readings
pay
attention
will
fine
-----
as
the
negative
comments
have
revealedif
you
are
taking
cs
just
because
everyone
is
it
don't
take
bloomberg
to
be
really
engaged
successful
but
doesn't
shed
from
fact
that
he
a
fantastic
professor
capable
make
material
interesting
will
let
up
for
your
mistake
if

-----
thorough
textbook
reading
is
a
must
in

couldn't

feel
like
the

away
-----
mixed
feelings
about
this
class
lectures
are
boring
but
you
have
to
pay
attention
because
the
exams
really
tough
a
big
portion
of
your
grade
will
be
homework
which
is
relatively
easy
seriously
readings
not
necessary
for

would
suggest
studying
them
midterm

final
-----
made
me
decide
to
no
longer
be
a
computer
science
major
his
practice
tests
do
not

you
for
the
exam
i
would
recommend
taking
different

if
possible

tougher
but
overall

is
not

amos
good

and
teaches

quite
well

you
have
more

a
very
helpful
and
informative
professor
although
he
didn't
seem
like
it
at
first
hard
to
reach
him
by
email
which
gave
the
impression
that
want
talk
students
but
turns
out
he's
actually
rather
approachable
in
person
do
homework
yourself
really
understand
concepts
because
exams
are
difficult
-----
his
lectures
are
kind
of
dull
but
they
can
be
helpful
if
you
pay
attention
he
loves
taking
questions
so
that's
good
just
go
to
him
have
the
tests
seem
hard
at
first
and
then
get
essentials
python
will
become
much
easier
a
nice
choice
cs
is
interesting
-----
hes
a
solid
choice
very
clear
and
thorough
available
outside
class
however
his
exams
are
long
often
dont
test
the
material
in
way
thats
considered
effective
this
leads
students
who
lose
focus
after
while
to
do
worse
if
youre
reading
amos
i
bet
u
concepts
that
require
much
writing
-----
professor
bloomberg
gives
a
very
informative
presentation
of
the

his

at

very
caring
and
kind
you
learn
mostly
by
doing
your
homework
he's
always
willing
to

know
the
material
his
tests
are
of
weird
some
exam
questions

class
lots
of
reading
but
can
get
away
w
not
doing
all
it
heavy
class-discussions
and
abt
90%
what
she
mentions
lecture
is
exactly
on
the
exam
no
trick
questions
at
oddly
specific
times
her
papers
allow
for
a
lot
creativity
she's
decently
easy
grader
had
cf1
as
well
-----
so
terrible
i
can
not
warn
enough
people
against
this
professor
please
do
take
her
she
takes
about
a
month
to
grade
the
smallest
things
but
then
assigns
hours
worth
of
homework
every
night
we
are
supposed
get
final
grades
72
after
here
am
almost
two
weeks
without
boring
and
-----
absolute
worst
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
don't
take
this
professor
been
almost
two
weeks
since
the
final
still
haven't
gotten
grade
yet
expects
us
to
extreme
amounts
of
work
but
then
doesn't
actually
any
grading
for
class
minu
makes
me
so
angry
she
is
literally
teacher
i've
ever
had
-----
worst
professor
i've
had
so
far
at
nyu
lectures
are
extremely
boring
and
there
is
always
least
one
person
dozing
off
of
already
asleep
during
each
class
she
assigns
multiple
videos
readings
every
night
sends
out
massive
emails
that
too
overwhelming
to
read
took
her
over
a
month
grade
short
paper
would
not
take
again
-----
awful
she
has
preferences
between
students
her
classes
are
boring
gives
too
many
readings
-----
very
hard
to
follow
her
and
she
expects
a
lot
from
you
with
reading
it's
not
class
but
its
confusing
can't
lectures
so
that
makes
it
there
are
many
amazing
other
teachers
at
nyu
there's
no
reason
take
mediocre
teacher
-----
she's
a
nice
lady
but
her
class
drag
on
gives
way
too
much
homework-
multiple
half
hour
videos
and
chapters
to
read
per
night
it's
overwhelming
boring
focuses
lot
architecture
art
from
the
middle
east
-----
she
gives
way
too
much
readings
grades
pretty
easy
but
the
lectures
were
just
so
boring
she's
you're
average
college
professor
put
in
no
effort
b+
some
you'll
get
an
a-
you
gotta
work
really
hard
for
a
though
-----
she
is
a
very
sweet
lady
and
passionate
about
what
teaches
assigns
lot
of
readings
before
class
however
you
don't
really
have
to
do
it
understand
pretty
easy
grader
if
take
notes
in
include
that
your
essays
overall
good
would
definitely
her
again
-----
super
sweet
&
caring
but
she
assigns
a
lot
of
homework
and
reading
in
preparation
for
class
she's
very
passionate
makes
lectures
interesting
though
-----
mrs
tharoor
doesn't
make
an
entertaining
class
the
papers
aren't
given
back
with
good
feedback
and
she
grades
them
very
specifically
lay
out
what
exactly
wants
or
final
i
took
her
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
again
-----
when
i
say
she's
a
tough
grader
mean
that
subjectively
style
in
your
papers
is
punished
-
eg
if
you
reference
an
aphorism
adage
or
make
anything
close
to
resembling
assertive
argument
you'll
be
penalized
treat
the
essays
as
ap
literature
prompt
and
probably
pretty
well
off
don't
take
risks
with
writing
-----
such
a
great
teacher
the
reviews
dont
do
her
justice
she
is
very
passionate
enthusiastic
knowledgeable
and
kind
she's
constantly
asking
if
workload
manageable
participation
necessary
seeing
as
class
discussion
based
but
it
doesnt
feel
overwhelming
so
far
1

3
pages
long

super
easy
final
-----
great
class
if
you
don't
like
to
participate
then
her
classes
aren't
for
very
helpful
with
giving
feedback
on
essay
drafts
exams
are
straightforward
and
easy
enough
study
she's
so
nice
makes
the
subject
enjoyable
learn
not
a
can
coast
though
put
in
work
you'll
be
fine
-----
i
really
loved
having
professor
tharoor
the
whole
class
if
pretty
easy
you
are
interested
in
topic
and
do
readings
for
homework
she
loves
opinions
discussions
never
tells
anyone
they
wrong
papers
to
write
but
gives
a
lot
of
feedback
is
tough
grader
use
her
comments
guide
next
paper
-----
super
passionate
about
the
material
and
inspires
you
to
appreciate
texts
art
not
a
lot
of
work
primarily
mid-term
final
paper
she'll
call
on
participate
because
she
genuinely
wants
talk
text
great
feedback
papers
very
smart
woman
take
her
look
up
has
huge
connections
in
india
-----
the
exams
are
unnecessarily
specific
if
you
don't
ingest
caffeine
will
not
stay
awake
in
this
class
i
seriously
hate
all
gls
classes
specifically
cultural
foundations
-----
i
still
see
her
in
my
dreams
-----
nice
person
but
her
grading
is
very
harsh
-----
this
class
was
unnecessarily
hard
because
of
him
it
basically
american
government
101
but
he
rushed
through
1000
concepts
made
difficult
midterm
wasn't
that
bad
final
asked
specific
questions
when
didn't
go
in-depth
to
the
me
rethink
my
politics
major
avoid
at
all
costs
-----
some
classes
were
very
interesting
overall
good
choice
out
of
the
fore
core
politics
reqs
would
take
after
international
because
game
theory
is
tested
on
but
he
doesn't
spend
much
time
teaching
it
assuming
most
us
have
taken
a
class
readings
are
and
manageable
not
really
necessary
to
do
textbook
ones
-----
gordon
is
a
decent
professor
lectures
range
between
extremely
interesting
to
mediocre
midterm
was
25%
game
theory
despite
never
teaching
it
i
got
lucky
because
my
friends
had
taken
before
and
taught
me
random
2
question
quizzes
are
given
almost
every
other
class
easy
than
the
quirky
guy
-----
sg
tells
you
to
study
your
notes
from
the
lectures
for
exam
meanwhile
midterm
is
based
solely
on
supplemental
readings
and
game
theory
he
flys
through
one
class
gt
yet
it's
worth
25%
wtf
dude
would
not
advise
missing
lecture
because
there
are
random
pop
quizzes
which
difficult
10%
of
grade
-----
gordon
taught
my
lecture
for
power
and
politics
in
america
not
an
easy
class
but
it
was
fairly
interesting
full
of
game
theory
so
beware
gives
pop
quizzes
occasionally
they're
multiple
choice
you
def
have
to
pay
attention
write
down
what
he
says
what's
on
the
board
does
allow
pics
slides
or
laptops
great
meet
with
-----
tries
too
hard
to
be
funny
organized
lectures
but
the
content
can
get
pretty
confusing
and
muddled;
course
is
heavy
on
game
theory
hope
for
a
good
ta
helpfulness
wise
review
sessions
are
hit-or-miss
depending
people
who
ask
questions

-----
lectures
somewhat
interesting
exams
are
tough
but
grading
is
fair
if
you
want
to
get
an

the

good
notes
and
read
all
of
blackboard&
kollman

dont
bother
with
lgsa
unless
youre
confused
learn
alot
very
thorough
class
pay
attention
&try
will
easily
find
it
useful
-----
though
the
exams
are
somewhat
tough
if
you
do
readings
and
study
outline
that
he
gives
before
will
well
class
is
exteremly
interesting
really
learn
ins
outs
of
american
politics
-----
he
is
a
mess
granted
his
lectures
are
often
entertaining;
however
what
presents
in
class
does
not
reflect
the
exams
examples
uses
straighforward
questions
on
exam
expects
you
to
think
quickly
your
feet--a
quality
that
many
undergrads
posess
please
avoid
at
all
costs
-----
clear
and
fascinating
lectures
a
reasonable
amount
of
reading
which
is
largely
interesting
tests
papers
that
are
challenging
but
doable
-----
he
reminded
me
of
stephen
colbert
his
lectures
always
seemed
very
straightforward
and
so
did
the
textbook
but
blackboard
readings
were
hell
however
exams
had
challenging
multiple
choice
i
no
idea
where
questions
came
from
answers
like:
none
above
a
&
b
c
frustrating
easy
grading
on
paper
-----
his
class
was
not
that
bad
just
pay
attention
to
the
lectures
he
nice
enough
post
an
outline
of
every
lecture
at
end
semester
and
with
explanations
game
theory
did
make
fun
interesting
tas
were
pretty
easy
on
grading
gave
you
all
answers
if
asked
them
for
help
later
-----
this
has
to
be
the
worst
politics
class
i
have
taken
exams
were
difficult:
he
gave
you
straightforward
information
in
and
then
expected
an
epihany
on
test
when
threw
game
theory
that
never
seen
your
life
multiple
choice
was
tricky
looked
like:
a
b
c
a&b
b&c
ab&c
all
of
above
come
-----
exams
were
tough
each
exam
was
30-40%
multiple
choice
the
point
of
which
seemed
to
be
trick
you
rather
than
test
comprehension
game
theory
equally
difficult
as
there
always
an
additional
element
models
that
had
not
been
reviewed
in
class
we
supposed
reason
out
during
he's
also
fairly
arrogant
-----
this
class
was
a
mess
the
tests
came
out
of
no
where
there
is
reason
why
multiple
choice
should
be
difficult
game
theory
on
exam
completely
different
from
what
he
shows
you
in
exams
will
make
want
to
crap
yourself
does
not
communicate
with
tas
because
they
had
idea
were
going
like
-----
excellent
clear
and
often
witty
lectures
grade
based
entirely
on
exams
which
are
not
to
difficult
if
you
go
lecture
read
for
the
course
-----
professor
gordon
always
starts
class
with
something
to
get
our
attentionhe's
pretty
square
glasses
and
sportcoats
but
then
he's
like
yo
wassup
he
keeps
the
exciting--the
powerpoints
are
dry
makes
them
interesting
challenges
you
by
including
exam
questions
from
slides
cool
-----
one
of
the
cool
teachers
who
makes
class
enjoyable
just
study
his
lectures
and
you'll
be
fine
-----
he
is
the
best
professor
i've
had
amazing
his
lectures
are
great
perfect
balance
b
w
textbook
outside
reading
info
on
slides
and
him
talking
very
straightforward
exams
attendance
not
mandatory
but
if
you
go
to
you'll
do
a
lot
better
makes
it
interesting
so
want
take
class
-----
great
professor
always
well
spoken
and
has
a
sense
of
humor
definitely
take
his
classes
-----
if
you
take
this
class
for
core
be
ready
to
study
very
minute
and
irrelevant
information
he
emphasizes
concepts
understanding
theories
yet
wants
memorize
a
specific
details
one
of
the
questions
asked
like
fish
may
enjoy
transitional
creature
it
was
tiktaalik
not
an
easy
expect
hard
-----
i
never
really
write
reviews
but
feel
like
have
to
something
for
this
if
you're
considering
taking
class
be
prepared
jot
notes
about
every
single
detail
he
says
in
because
the
midterms
and
final
are
based
100%
off
trivial
facts
that
mentioned
ie
name
species
we
talked
no
concepts
memorization
-----
i
loved
professor
volk
he's
a
sweet
hippie
who
really
loves
what
he
teaches
exams
were
difficult
because
it
was
lot
of
memorization
but
still
enjoyed
the
class
and
his
enthusiasm
-----
just
make
sure
you
read
the
material
and
ask
questions
where
you're
confused
there
is
an
emphasis
on
knowing
facts
so
if
don't
understand
this
could
be
hardest
part
of
class
-----
i
has
volk
for
state
and
fate
of
the
earth
jterm
in
sydney
loved
his
class
so
much
it
was
extremely
interesting
he's
such
a
cool
guy
only
text
book
we
used
it's
very
interestingly
written
kind
reads
like
story
he
allows
freedom
your
final
project
too
take
this
-----
do
not
take
this
class
lectures
are
boring
and
he
writes
a
few
random
words
on
paper
that
is
projected
to
the
both
midterms
finals
it
makes
no
sense
exams
unnecessarily
hard
with
confusing
questions
then
doesn't
curve
don't
buy
textbooks
its
useless
hated
ruined
my
gpa
-----
professor
volk
is
an
excellent
he's
very
passionate
about
what
he
teaches
so
that
makes
his
lectures
interesting
especially
during
organism
moments
said
are
sometimes
slow
but
if
you
go
to
lecture
and
over
your
notes
before
the
exam
it's
easy
get
a
-----
do
not
take
this
class
his
lectures
are
incoherent
and
he
sprawls
random
words
down
on
the
projector
then
bases
exams
entirely
them
it's
about
memorizing
learning
labs
boring
recommend
-----
definitely
recommend
this
class
for
easy
a
you
have
to
go
every
lecture
though
because
the
tests
are
based
on
notes
before
an
exam
carefully
read
handouts
and
previous
exams
skim
book
you're
all
set
don't
memorize
stuff
in
unless
he
covered
it
labs
extremely
boring
-----
awful
do
not
take
him
test
are
insanely
detailed
lectures
boring
minus
those
few
beautiful
minutes
known
as
the
organism
moments
labs
aren't
that
bad
but
his
tests
enough
to
convince
me
class
is
just
worth
taking
oh
and
one
more
thing
you
need
3
different
textbooks
for
this
cool
-----
the
course
placed
much
more
emphasis
on
rogue
memorization
of
details
rather
than
actual
understanding
material
--
i
disapprove
-----
i
hate
to
contradict
the
consensus
opinion
on
here
but
i've
regretted
taking
a
class
with
volk
for
an
entire
semester
evaluates
details
not
lessons
as
map
program
is
designed
test
highly
unstructured
boring
and
his
use
of
illegible
slides
frustrating
unacceptable
nice
guy
terribly
-----
class
somewhat
interesting
although
that's
just
being
nice
tests
pretty
hard
if
you
do
moderately
well
on
exams
re-read
his
notes
extremely
carefully
&
text
book
i
believe
remember
he
pulled
random
information
from
there
too
and
very
in
the
lab
not
you'll
be
fine
yet
again
easier
said
than
done
professor
btw
-----
tyler's
a
very
approachable
professor
but
yes
there
are
lot
of
details
especially
concerning
co2
what
else
would
you
expect
from
someone
so
passionate
about
the
environment
his
exams
indeed
quite
bafflinghard
to
tell
whether
did
well
or
not
assignments
interesting
like
homework
overall
he's
fair
grader
-----
lectures
came
mostly
from
the
books
but
it
was
more
enjoyable
to
go
class
we
showed
organism
moment
videos
about
random
intereing
animals
tests
previous
years
were
available
online
and
provided
a
good
idea
of
what
study
labs
boring
very
high-school
like
incredibly
easy
also
he
is
likable
good-looking
-----
dorky
and
lovable
keeps
class
interesting
you
have
to
go
lecture
though
because
his
exams
are
surprisingly
difficult
he
fills
them
with
random
details
only
mentioned
in
passing
during
so
pay
attention
take
good
notes
pretty
nat
sci
ii
course
-----
professor
volk
is
an
amazing
teacher
who
keeps
his
class
extremely
interested
in
the
cirruculum
he
cares
deeply
about
what
he's
teaching
and
it
shows
tests
are
easy
questions
such
as
name
of
our
textbook
always
posts
a
test
from
previous
year
to
study
online
week
before
-----
this
class
is
extremely
boring
and
impossible
tons
of
details
covered
you
must
remember
every
single
detail
if
want
to
get
a
good
grade
nearly
especially
since
the
subject
matter
so
irrelevant
volk
fails
make
any
it
interesting
despite
his
personal
fascination
with
all
do
not
take
-----
this
class
is
a
huge
joke
volk
good
guy
and
makes
the
horribly
boring
material
semi-interesting
however
come
test
time
he
mkaes
tests
very
difficult
expects
you
to
be
genius
if
dont
do
readings
are
screwed
-----
i
took
environmental
systems
science
with
him
he
explained
the
material
well
in
class
but
as
long
you
did
reading
from
textbook
tests
were
very
easy
--
especially
if
are
familiar
physics
or
chemistry
don't
have
to
go
usually
all
is
book
-----
i
took
her
for
cf1
and
cf2
so
caring
she
wants
students
to
do
well
participate
in
class
will
love
you
your
if
just
show
are
putting
the
effort
go
office
hours
guide
right
direction
written
assignments
can't
say
enough
great
things
about
-----
professor
newman
cares
it
is
very
evident
that
she
wants
her
students
to
do
well
and
genuinely
enjoys
being
around
in
class
participate
meet
with
about
papers
spark
up
conversations
you'll
however
i
was
incredibly
bored
this
hated
going
pick
a
different
-----
she
is
fine
but
sorta
boring
+rambles
and
sometimes
a
hard
marker
-----
at
the
beginning
of
semester
i
thought
that
had
made
a
mistake
by
taking
prof
newman;
but
it
turned
out
to
be
just
opposite
she
is
really
funny
and
although
can
come
off
as
being
hard-ass
kind
appreciates
people
who
do
reading
participate
in
class
-----
generally
in
both
cf
and
sf
all
you
have
to
do
is
read
you're
usually
good
newman
a
great
teacher
really
cares
lectures
are
fun
if
confused
about
something
can
ask
her
not
that
hard

this
was
the
only
bad
teacher
i
had

a
lot
about
baseball
but
grading
papers
arbitrarily
based
on

juvenile

she
loves

-----
although
she
is
a
tough
but
fair
paper
grader
prof
newman
gives
chances
to
bring
grades
up
through
rewrites
also
does
students
favor
by
putting
such
heavy
emphasis
on

participation
which
can
your

quite
bit
as
long
you
read

definitely
like

although
she
is
a
tough
grader
on
papers
prof
newman
gives
plenty
of
chances
to
bring
those
grades
up
through
rewrites
also
helps
you
out
by
giving

participation
heavy
influence

do
the
reading
and
most
importantly
talk
will
like

anyone
who
complains
about
newman
is
obviously
stuck
in
high
school
she
the
epitome
of
an
amazing
college
professor
yes
she's
a
tough
grader
sometimes
but
gets
you
to
grow
up
and
realize
that
tests
aren't
matching
or
multiple
choice
essays
actually
have
make
sense
funny
sweet
go
her
for
extra
help
very
brilliant

tough

when

so
i
had
her
for

social
foundations
and
while
liked
hated
the

felt
grading
was
difficult
also
a

is
amazing
though
participation=
way
better
grade
very
smart
woman
really
interesting
projects
were
fun
best
of
all
there
no

-----
avoid
this
professor
at
all
costs
she
is
dreadful
and
completely
full
of
her
'brooklyn'
self
ridiculously
hard
grader
who
will
allot

not

whether

you
are

favorites
take
any
other

worst
in

had

she
was
unorganized
changed
the

many

she's
pretty
clear
on
what
will
be

such
a

dr
phelps
is
an
awesome
professor
for
intro
to
psych
this
course
covers
so
much
information
and
she
comes
at
it
in
a
really
organized
way
posts
all
the

great
professor
really
interesting
i
didn't
notice
until
actually
read
the
textbook
which
you
should
do
but
she's
cited
mentioned
in
numerous
times
just
goes
to
show
that
she
knows
her
stuff
if
already
figure
out
from
lectures
-----
easy
class
if
you
go
to
lecture
and
read
the
book
she's
passionate
about
subject
is
very
clear
what
looking
for
in
exams
she
basically
tells

no
reason
not
get
an
a
actually
put
work

this
was
one
of
the
easiest
classes
i
have
taken

it's
gonna
be
tough
if
you
don't
read
textbook
and
go
to
lecture
but
do
those
things
keep
up
with
reading
really
easy
get
an
a
not
ridiculous
amount

really
randomly
specific

nitpicky

know
the
exact

is
great
though

to

because
anecdotes
help
you

absolutely
brilliant

things
very
clearly
and
tells
funny
stories
that
break
up
the

you
remember
it
as

tough
so
don't
skip

phelps
for

professor
phelps
is
knowledgeable
and
passionate
about

information
conveyed
clearly
during

she's
not
always
available
for

she's
great
incredibly
intelligent

really
quirky

although
i
disagree
with
the
people
below
find
that
phelps
was
a
great
professor
nonetheless
her
exams
were
manageable
but
test
graders
absolutely
ruthless
making
it
hard
to
get
solid
did
pull
off
b+
by
attending
all

purely
amazing

she's
an
awesome

is
able
to
communicate
it
the
class
very
well
personally
i
dedicated
most

worth
as

be
ruthless

yoav
seemed
very
unprepared
during
class
he
had
an
attitude
whenever
students
asked
questions
because
skips
too
many
key
points
about
using
the
tools

the
course
structure
is
open
ended
a
lot
of
creative
space
given
to
explore
new
ideas
for

taught
are
widely
used
in

and
through

i
really
love
this
course
and
professor
pro:

yoav
stubbornly
refused
helping
me
and
other
students
when
we
had
problems

to
acknowledge
was
making

use
tools
that
did
not
work
as
described
never
tried
doing
the
assignments
himself
make
sure
they
were
possible
deserves
0s
-----
personally
i
feel
that
yoav
expects
too
much
from
us
we
have
to
learn
and
use
something
new
pretty
every
week
in
the
project
wouldn't
be
a
problem
except
his
explanations
class
usually
don't
suffice
you
end
up
being
confused
when
try
do
it
yourself
all
lot
if
slack
though

i
would
not
recommend
taking
this
class
if
you
are
using
a
laptop
all
the
weird
plugins
and
tools
needed
slow
your
computer
to
crawl

made
an
ok
game
during

really
basic
but
better
than
most
other
students
unfortunately
no

only
on

yoav

knew
the
basics
of
weird

were
required
to
use

could
not
solve
many
problems
students
faced
with

effort
get

negative
feelings
for

i
developed
from
this

and
finally

enjoying

did

was
very
difficult
finding
any

look
at
gaming

please
be
advised
yoav
assigned
extra
homework
on

a

of

missed

and
were
harshly
penalized
using
his
grading
policy
also
note
website
syllabus
are
not
written
in

expect
them
to
change
for
worst
like
did
my

i
wish
the
professor
was
more
approachable
but
he
ran
out
after
every
class
time
emailed
him
a
question
just
repeated
back
without
answering
it
in
general
got
impression
only
knows
tools
on
surface
and
did
not
actually
know
how
things
worked
under
hood

professor
was
extremely
approachable
and
quick
to
respond
both
online
offline
i
enjoyed
the
group
project
portion
of
course
which
is
very
much
like
a
professional
situation
although
curriculum
centered
around
gaming
learned
lot
about
server
side
processing
persistence
security
other
things
that
apply
any
web
app

this
course
is
interesting
and
need
some
independent
studythis
a
which
very
close
to
real
life
work
i
got
high
paying
job
in
company
developing
browser
games
because
of
project
experience

beware
you
only
have
the
first
2
classes
obviously
easiest
to
decide
if
your
going
stay
in
class
or
drop
it
with
a
refund
make
sure
are
aware
deadlines
i
waited
too
long
out
and
wish
hadnt
just
kept
spiralling
worst
as
semester
progressed

i
really
wanted
to
like
this
class
but
the
expectations
were
unclear
from
first
lecture
walks
varied
by
which
ta
or
professor
was
giving
them
it
so
hard
know
what

could
be
a
great

logistics
and
made

major
some
people
had
time

took
the
architecture
core
class
and
absolutely
loved
it
it's
a
dense
once

very
interesting
changed
way

look
at

mosette
is
a
great
professor
she
so
knowledgable
and
her
class
very
open

it'll
be

topics
discussed
in
class
might
be
a
little
challenging
if
you
are
unfamiliar
with
nyc
or
its
history
of
urban
development
but
as
long
put
effort
into
researching
and
go
through
all
the
announcement
articles
would
extremely
rewarding
-----
professor
broderick's
lectures
are
as
entertaining
hollywood
movies
she
is
also
very
sympathetic
approachable
and
reasonable
my
one
complaint
that
euro-centric
-
it
would
have
been
cool
to
learn
about
cities
in
africa
asia
the
middle
east
but
we
barely
discussed
them
only
talked
europe
america
-----
really
into
all
her
lectures
wealth
of
knowledge
and
funny
tests
papers
are
hard
as
there
is
not
much
guidance
unless
you
ask
for
it
the
easiest
grader
but
definitely
wants
best
students
loved
this
class
-----
i
took
her
for
arch
of
ny
she
was
such
a
fabulous
professor
with
so
much
knowledge
in
field
the
exams
require
fair
bit
effort
but
clear
and
pleasant
tas
were
equally
helpful
this
class
made
me
value
liberal
arts
education
-----
professor
broderick
was
my
favorite
while
at
nyu
it's
true
that
the
course
is
a
lot
of
memorization
and
not
an
easy
but
her
stories
were
fascinating
it
so
much
fun
to
learn
more
exploring
city
take
this
class
if
you
want
great
experience
definitely
walk
around
in
broderick's
group
-----
i
absolutely
love
this
professor
she
knows
her
topics
inside
and
out
loves
when
students
have
an
issue
that
they
want
to
talk
about
expects
a
lot
but
is
willing
give
second
chances
extra
help
will
get
off
topic
learned
just
as
much
from
tangents
really
funny
wit
lecturing
style
can't
say
enough
good
things
-----
i
could
not
have
ever
hoped
for
a
more
helpful
or
kind
professor
deeply
cares
her
students
and
somehow
seems
to
know
everyone
personally
she
is
very
engaging
lecturer
knows
everything
about
subject
terribly
difficult
if
you
are
in
class
regularly
love
this
woman
-----
the
professor
broderick
and
her
ta's
are
great
but
architecture
of
ny:
a
field
study
is
ridiculous
it's
pure
memorization
60
buildings
per
exam
only
to
be
tested
on
8
don't
take
it
as
an
easy
map
course
-----
prof
broderick
is
one
of
the
most
fascinating
intellectuals
i
have
ever
had
privilege
learning
from
she
can
get
side-tracked
easily
so
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
yes
expects
a
lot
her
students
but
wants
nothing
more
than
for
them
succeed
and
will
try
accommodate
as
much
-----
professor
broderick
is
the
rare
intellectual
who
remains
down-to-earth
and
personable
you
will
not
regret
taking
her
class
-
i
promise
-----
wonderful
teacher
the
sweetest
and
most
caring
professor
i
have
ever
had
she
takes
time
to
make
you

work
with
one-on-one
until
do

understanding
hard-working
has
even
helped
job
searching
try
take
her
field

course
next
semester

at
nyu
-----
genuinely
nice
and
interested
in
how
students
are
doing
very
passionate

i'm
a
politics
student
even
i
didn't
dread
this
weekly
friday
afternoon

tas
approachable
competent
best
of
all--they
grade
exams
papers
timely
fashion
take
getting
used
to
but
consider
improvement
for
final
-----
most
unreasonable
professor
i
have
ever
had
first
day
of
class
asked
to
take
the
midterm
early
bc
a
conflict
she
said
sure
then
when
time
came
tried
refuse
let
me
it
at
all
dean;
with
final
lost
my
paper
blamed
on
and
fail
delusional
liar
-----
she
is
a
great
professor
but
sometimes
rambles
on
and
it
very
hard
to
keep
up
with
what
talking
about
also
the
entire
class
grade
based
one
essay
mid-term
final
so
if
you
screw
of
those
you're
screwed
-----
extremely
helpful
to
the
students
she
can
drag
on
and
about
a
topic
sometimes
but
has
point
even
in
that
blabbering
i
had
absoluetly
no
interest
this
until
took
her
class
passion
willingness
help
out
led
me
major
urban
design
def
take
one
of
better
profs
at
nyu
-----
awesome
professor
obviously
passionate
about
the
topic
and
very
open
to
hearing
student
concerns
questions
ideas
helpful
loves
creative
thinking
you
have
pay
attention
work
in
her
class
but
it's
worth
it
won't
be
bored
-----
professor
roth
is
one
of
the
worst
professors
i
have
ever
had
she
assigned
two
quizzes
three
papers
and
a
final
exam
for
semester
only
got
around
to
grading
nothing
else
lecture-heavy
tests
on
information
that
isn't
discussed
clearly
there
also
ton
reading
don't
take

unless
you

lectures
very
heavily
but
i'm
a
heavy
lecture
person
so
that's
fine
for
me
spends
lot
of
time
to
grade
hw
i
got
my
essay
turned
in
mid
october
early
feb
knowledgeable
bit
disorganized
eager

and
approachable
not

aren't
hard
many

was
44
pgs
-----
low
commitment
class
that
will
have
you
write
4
papers
and
take
two
exams
for
a
core
isn't
bad
the
lectures
are
unstructured
but
taking
good
notes
is
possible
as
long
sit
in
front
so
can
catch
what
she
says
posts
study
guides
doesn't
post
powerpoints
attendance
sheet
passed
around

who
there
-----
insane
lecture
style
waffles
all
over
the
place
and
mixes
stuff
on
exam
with
personal
asides
not
really
textbook
based
no
handout
notes
does
publish
overheads
if
you
invest
time
can
pass
this
but
i
would
take
again
-----
took
cultures
and
contexts
knowledgeable
on
the
subject
doesn't
necessarily
translate
to
her
being
an
good
or
even
adequate
professor
goes
off
tangents
shows
up
late
not
mention
that
she
takes
extreme
amount
of
time
grade
work
inconsistent
grading
got
my

month
half
after

-----
professor
roth
is
overly
interested
in
the
subject
and
unclear
as
to
what
information
relevant
just
her
going
off
on
tangents
incredibly
boring
lots
of
work
-----
i
don't
understand
how
she
has
such
low
ratings
have
to
agree
with
some
of
the
critiques
about
her
lecture
style
-
she's
so
enthusiastic
egypt
that
at
times
doesn't
realize
or
perhaps
just
care
when
dragging
on
and
however
extremely
helpful
understanding
know
by
experience
-----
loves
egypt
but
too
much
would
rather
hear
her
own
voice
than
teach
doesn't
learn
students
names
values
social
life
over
class
shows
up
late
often
takes
months
to
grade
papers
that
shouldn't
take
more
a
week
two
at
most
constantly
changes
due
dates
unorganized
can't
remember
what
she
has
hasn't

she
gave
interesting
lectures
at
8am
so
it
was
hard
to
stay
awake
midterm
and
final
were
pretty
straight
forward
4
papers
write
all
grades
fairly
-----
i
didn't
know
that
art
history
could
be
boring
until
had
this
professor
completely
unhelpful
unclear
late
on
returning
emails
assignments
posting
reviews
she
may
just
need
some
more
teacher
training
-----
roth
is
an
organizational
mess
and
always
late
essay
grading
skewed;
they
have
a
strange
system
where
your
essays
aren't
graded
by
one
person
but
shuffled
between
the
tas
were
anally
midterm
easy
attendance
lectures
unclear
overall
not
or
fun
class
take
another
cultures

-----
by
far
the
worst
class
i
have
ever
taken
when
grading
essays
professor
and
two
instructors
completely
different
subjective
approaches
leading
to
an
incorrectly
skewed
curve
of
recitations
were
enjoyable
but
did
not
relate
lectures
unorganized
incomprehensible
highly
regret
taking
this
-----
she
was
such
a
terrible
and
unorganized
professor
it
really
difficult
to
study
for
the
final
because
textbooks
don't
help
lectures
are
disconnected
class
fails
have
an
overarching
theme
just
seems
like
bunch
of
facts
learn
tas
were
somewhat
nice
but
even
they
pretty
harsh
in
grading
essays
-----
this
was
the
worst
class
i
have
ever
taken
signed
up
for
it
thinking
that
learning
about
ancient
egypt
would
be
fascinating
but
her
dry
lectures
put
me
to
sleep
and
studying
impossible
as
she
never
teaches
from
textbooks
i'd
recommend
if
your
life
revolves
around
egyptian
culture
much
like
hers
does
-----
i
had
her
for
culture
&
contexts:
egypt
the
course
was
sort
of
interesting
but
really
have
to
take
good
notes
since
she
doesn't
put
up
powerpoints
points
deducted
non-attendance
so
show
clear
grading
policy
on
how
get
an
a;
just
pay
attention
and
do
well
final
midterm
2
essays
-----
she
is
a
wonderful
teacher
her
lecture
are
sometimes
confusing
but
if
you
confused
visit
to
office
hours
very
helpful
has
wealth
of
information
share
especially
ask
specific
questions
also
active
on
dig
sites
in
egypt
giving
personal
experience
with
the
material
teaching
-----
easiest
class
i
ever
took
don't
need
to
read
just
pay
attention
what
she
says
in
the
stuff
that's
on
test
is
over
and
again
tests
were
exactly
like
study
guides
-----
she's
insane
and
rude
the
ta's
are
wonderful
though
-----
lectures
aren't
bad
as
people
say
and
the
material
is
interesting
but
she
refuses
to
post
power
points
tends
go
over
important
ideas
quickly
while
babbling
about
unimportant
ones
so
you
have
be
attentive
in
class
not
easy
a
map
course
&
lots
of
memorization
required
grade
depends
largely
on
your
ta
=
good
papers
knowledge
terms
-----
unbelievably
bad
massive
amounts
of
reading
which
have
often
seem
to
be
simply
punishment
as
they
no
connection
tests
and
are
far
too
long
actually
done
i
feel
rather
sad
that
she
is
this
obsessed
with
ancient
egypt
just
when
thought
knew
the
definition
boring
there
ol'
macy
roth
goes
beatin
out
my
expectations
-----
honestly
molly
was
not
the
best
class
discussion
really
common
sense
stuff
and
i
didn't
feel
like
even
learned
much
she
graded
papers
super
hard
she's
very
writing
intensive
-----
molly
is
a
great
choice
if
you
want
to
learn
enough
but
you're
looking
for
an
easy
just
go
class
participate
at
least
once
week
day
and
actually
read
you'll
do
well
on
the
one
essay
she
requires
write
what
you've
discussed
in
get
also
midterm
final

so
much
reading
always
make
sure
you
have
your
texts

or
else
she'll
basically
shame
front
of
everyone
can
be
dry
and
hard
to
stay
awake
for

was
easy
-----
professor
martin
was
an
amazing
teacher
for
cf
she
always
came
to
class
with
enthusiasm
and
while
others
thought
it
fake
i
can
ensure
you
that
her
kind
caring
attitude
is
genuine
great
extra
help
gave
students
every
possibility
succeed
ie
rewrites
learned
a
lot
in
which
my
goal
-----
she
is
an
amazing
professor
does
have
attitude
that
can
seem
fake
but
overall
really
nice
and
a
fair
grader
there
are
2
tests

the
final
text
analysis
if
you
listen
in
class
do
reading
will
pass
go
to
her
for
help
participate
like
-----
molly
was
one
of
the
nicest
and
most
genuine
professors
i
had
all
year
she
took
students'
opinions
into
account
when
coming
up
with
her
teaching
plan
always
ready
to
give
guidance
or
help
on
a
subject
topic
definitely
likes
participation
if
you
don't
will
kinda
drag
it
out
-----
her
lectures
are
ok
but
grades
absolute
nonsense
seriously
i
was
so
confused
about
my
the
whole
semester
if
you
get
nervous
participating
don't
take
class
she's
funny
and
looks
like
arizona
from
greys
anatomy
-----
yes
her
nicey
nice
attitude
can
seem
fake
because
it
mostly
is
but
you
should
take
class
participation
matters
if
do
participate
will
super
well
on
the
tests
she
reviews
in
depth
for
them
and
its
obvious
what
be
lets
resubmit

new
grade

up
to

get
an

super
sweet
if
you
participate
in
class
she
will
love
really
wanted
to
take
her
for
cf
2
but
was
unavailable
only
three
easy
tests
-----
prof
martin
is
a
fun
professor
but
expects
participation
she
very
open
to
students
coming
office
hours
or
emailing
her
with
questions
so
take
advantage
of
that
papers
are
pretty
easy
readings
not
the
most
interesting
try
keep
up
them
because
entire
final
comprise
passage
analysis
-----
molly
is
so
great
not
only
does
she
make
class
interesting
but
also
has
a
sense
of
humor
that
makes
the
relatable
yes
she's
young
it
her
more
understanding
cool
lady
be
prepared
to
read
and
apply
what
you
specifically
in
your
exams
-----
great
teacher
genuinely
cares
about
students
and
their
wellbeing
if
you
have
the
option
absolutely
take
her
-----
she
is
easy
in
class
her
essays'
topics
and
guidelines
are
too
ambiguous
abstract
not
very
helpful
when
you
meet
with
has
favorites
so
always
bring
your
texts
to
materials
interesting
if
interested
literature
-----
i
felt
like
learned
absolutely
nothing
and
then
got
a
bad
grade
for
it
did
pretty
well
on
my
essays
exams
but
ended
up
with
poor
thank
you
wasting
tuition
money
trying
to
make
life
so
much
more
difficult
-----
i
don't
know
why
i'm
stupid
enough
to
take
her
class
again
everything
she
says
is
complete
nonsense
the
grades
are
erratic
kindness
such
a
facade
she's
so
passive-aggressive
worst
experience
in
my
life
-----
molz
is
really
helpful
and
the
class
itself
relatively
easy
if
you
dont
bs
papers
-----
unintelligent
pretentious
harsh
grader
patronizing
demeanor
more
suited
to
an
elementary
school
rather
than
a
college
class
actually
would
have
hated
her
then
as
well
the
nice
facade
melts
away
soon
you
challenge
on
anything
fell
asleep
during
another
professor's
presentation
also
not
that
pretty
up
close
-----
don't
get
me
wrong
professor
martin
is
a
very
nice
person
but
if
you
agree
with
her
she
doesn't
like
and
thus
makes
feel
low
it's
obvious
who
favorites
are
she's
well-educated
knows
lot
about
the
subjects
teaches
it
that
more
than
do
-----
professor
martin
is
the
sweetest
woman
who
actually
cares
about
what
you
think
and
how
do
in
out
of
classroom
she
really
brilliant
approachable
willing
to
help
her
students
with
any
issue
-----
i
had
molly
for
cultural
ii
and
loved
her
the
assignments
were
always
fairly
easy
texts
she
chose
interesting
was
devastated
when
found
out
wasn't
teaching
cfiii
this
spring
she's
funny
highlights
importance
of
you
read
so
that
even
if
didn't
like
them
could
appreciate
-----
only
take
him
if
you
have
a
ton
of
time
to
dedicate
this
class
-----
my
friend
recommended
him
after
taking
for
wi
big
mistakes
listening
to
her
he
did
not
help
improve
writing
at
all
small
assignments
grade
nor
give
credit
for;
simply
wasted
time
because
pretty
much
stayed
same
readings
are
ok
but
mostly
jus
used
discussion
better
u
-----
his
grading
was
extremely
subjective;
made
me
write
a
paper
three
times
b
c
he
wanted
more
information
abt
my
mom
despite
following
every
part
of
guidelines
criteria
did
not
rlly
learn
anything
+
writing
improve
taking
class
lot
peer
wrk
getting
feedback
from
them
when
their
jus
horrible
no
help
whatsoever
-----
very
therapeutic
class
participation
matters
as
in
if
you
haven't
done
the
reading
and
he
randomly
calls
on
to
comment
then
you're
screwed
but
aren't
graded
this
so
take
that
will
-
he'll
probably
just
judge
his
feedback
is
great
my
writing
definitely
got
better
after
3-4
essays
total
guy
-----
professor
goldfin
was
an
amazing
writing
he
able
to
individually
address
each
of
our
struggles
with
and
help
us
evolve
while
also
encouraging
other
by
the
end
class
group
so
close
open
none
were
ready
for
it
taking
him
again
2
next
semester
-----
his
classes
are
very
relaxing
and
therapeutic
there's
a
lot
of
go-around-the-circle
so
as
long
you
do
the
homework
you'll
be
fine
he's
really
caring
in
general
likes
to
make
time
for
students
essay
topics
always
interesting;
i
had
fun
writing
all
them
highly
recommend
this
class
-----
loved
him
this
class
was
really
easy
and
we
always
had
fun
readings
essay
topics
only
4
essays
the
whole
semester
reading
responses
were
to
write
i
don't
think
my
writing
improved
all
that
much
but
his
definitely
favorite
from
first
goldfin
is
bae
-----
goldfin
is
such
a
great
teacher
he
attentive
to
our
individual
styles
of
writing
and
always
available
during
his
office
hours
the
class
itself
so
relaxing
easy
going
light
readings
almost
every
day
but
they
are
very
important
essays
assigns
love
him
-----
just
take
him
he
is
perfect
no
matter
what
-----
sooooo
sad
that
i'm
not
able
to
take
goldfin
for
writing
ii
literally
so
devastated
a
writer
by
nature
his
more
creative
approach
essays
was
very
welcome
tough
grader
and
lots
of
reading
but
the
readings
are
interesting
he's
really
chill
guy
honestly
it
felt
like
therapy
than
class
-----
i
loved
this
class
he's
very
creative
and
thinks
a
lot
about
writing
really
appreciated
the
feedback
he
gave
my
reading
selections
feel
improved
yet
was
breeze
never
cared
much
in
high
school
classes
but
totally
changed
perspective
-----
nice
guy
you
need
to
put
some
effort
into
what
write
if
enjoy
creative
writing
have
basic
skills
and
listen
closely
his
unique
assignments
will
find
your
pushed
places
didn't
expect
it
go
for
a
writer
this
is
awesome
be
attentive
present
engaged
he
fair
grader
in
criteria
-----
professor
goldfin
was
a
nice
person
and
wasn't
too
difficult
but
he
seemed
to
decide
what
grade
you'd
get
on
the
first
day
of
class
as
everyone
got
almost
same
all
papers
no
matter
how
good
or
bad
they
were
also
he'd
tell
you
in
wouldn't
match
up
with
comments
leave
your
paper
-----
profesor
goldfin
is
wonderful
he
has
a
genuine

you
do

effort
you'll
be
fine
take
his

won't
regret
it
-----
he
is
a
great
teacher
and
very
helpful
i
can
truly
say
i've
learned
lot
from
him
the
work
pretty
easy
there
are
only
4
essays
weekly
literature
reflection
papers
-however
grade
you
receive
completely
up
in
air
attended
all
classes
did
however
got
b+
for
semester
-----
took
him
for
writing
i
he's
very
easy
and
the
work
load
is
manageable
but
his
grading
kind
of
out
blue
feel
like
with
all
professors
you
could
be
a
great
writer
if
they
don't
your
style
won't
get

i'd
still
recommend
though
-----
professor
goldfin
is
truly
a
wonderful
teacher
his
class
has
an
easy
going
pace
and
he
always
gives
you
chance
to
rewrite
if
don't
like
your
grade
taught
me
so
much
about
the
process
of
writing
essay
it
was
pleasure
be
in
i
highly
recommend
him
anyone
taking

-----
i
loved
professor
goldfin
the
workload
is
nothing
close
to
overwhelming
--
there
a
major
piece
of
essay
due
every
few
weeks
and
in
between
he
assigns
great
essays
read
that
relate
writing
class
working
on
allows
you
revise
will
occasionally
change
your
grade
once
get
used
him
it's
-----
before
students
pick
him:
read
this
first:
it
is
a
serious
risk
he
unfair
in
his
grading
some
of
my
friends
class
are
doing
fine
if
you
get
an
on
the
1st
paper
you'll
be
for
rest
but
everyone
else
practically
ordained
b
even
go
see
him
help
your
essay
that
doesn't
guarantee
youll
do
well
-----
teacher
is
really
nice
but
you
dont
do
anything
in
the
class
insanely
boring
and
hes
very
anal
about
smallest
things
like
grammar
on
papers
if
talk
a
lot
he'll
give
good
grade
i
found
him
annoying
other
kids
liked
rather
take
mary
roma
-----
if
you
are
someone
who
enjoys
writing
the
class
itself
is
pretty
boring
no
matter
which
professor
have
prof
jackson
makes
best
of
it
as
he
a
very
experienced
writer
and
fun
to
listen
engages
well
with
current
issues
eager
hear
different
perspectives
-----
a
bit
unorganized
but
easy
if
you
do
all
optional
drafts
and
read
your
daily
writings

i
learned
so
much
in
this
writing
course
not
sure
why
students
did
like
him
great
professor
-----
great
guy
and
a
really
good
conversationalist
but
he
is
very
hard
grader
values
our
in
class
discussions
so
attendance
must
the
topics
are
interesting
it
wasn't
big
deal
be
prepared
to
have
read
lot
try
space
his
work
out
over
semester
because
there
way
too
much
for
you
cram
last
minute
-----
easy
a
and
really
nice
guy
participation
is
important
kind
of
boring
class
but
i
think
that's
mainly
because
my
section
was
pretty
quiet
so
the
discussions
were
always
dead
-----
he's
a
brutal
grader
and
i
mean
that
in
the
best
way
possible
his
advice
is
incredibly
valuable
always
happy
to
give
it
this
first
writing
class
have
ever
struggled
couldn't
be
more
excited
-----
if
you
are
looking
to
actually
get
better
at
writing
professor
jackson
is
your
guy
everyone
on
here
complains
that
he
a
tough
grader
but
when
finally
it
the
best
subject
matter
really
interesting
expect
nightly
readings
i
have
grown
so
much
as
writer
-----
he
gives
great
advice
about
writing
in
general
but
doesn't
read
your
stories
that
closely
&
can't
keep
track
of
characters
show
up
to
class
on
time
or
apologize
for
not
doing
so;
never
has
his
notes
prompts
cued
and
takes
forever
find
them
if
you
like
professors
are
more
students
take
him
otherwise
don't
-----
take
professor
jackson
if
you
want
to
improve
your
writing
skills
he
is
a
fountain
of
knowledge
regarding
creative
non
fiction
and
can
offer
valuable
lessons
make
the
effort
an
perfect
score
wants
see
improvement
so
don't
expect
high
grade
on
first
drafts
he's
cool
dude
too
-----
professor

a
tough
grader
but
you

always
willing
to
help
you
just
read
the
texts
and
you'll
do
fine
really
gave
me
some
good
writing
advice
-----
i
see
most
people
complaining
about
him
not
being
an
easy
grader
and
making
you
work
for
it
but
what
do
know
is
that
when
mitchell
was
giving
good
grades
he
accused
by
a
student
that's
fact
guess
can't
win
losing
on
this
one

with
my

another
teacher
if
you
want
an
he
gives
bad
grade
doesn't
wanna
talk
about
why
how

come
man
chill

-----
extremely
hard
to
please
never
seems
satisfied
with
your
essays
nor
re-writes
not
mention
answers
his
emails
although
knows
everyone
in
hip-hop
he
cares
about
students
always
late
-sometimes
doesn't
show
up
so
don't
bother
showing
early
impress
him-
nothing
impresses
him
like
dorks
-----
the
worst
writing
professor
ever
you
start
out
your
essay
with
a
possible
b-
picks
favorites
harsh
grader
don't
take
him
-----
you
would
appreciate
your
improvement
in
writing
so
much
more
after
have
taken
this
class
my
improved
and
he
gives
clear
advice
on
ways
to
improve
he's
pretty
funny
interesting
it
helps
stay
engaged

cool
man
very
helpful
and
funny
i
enjoyed
his
class
much
-----
he
is
so
cool
and
can
really
help
you
improve
your
writing
-----
i
learned
a
lot
and
sana
is
great
person
but
lectures
are
really
not
so
meaningful
she
grades
very
leniently
which
makes
the
class
pretty
easy
can
be
super
hard
to
follow
sometimes
had
teach
myself
bunch
of
stuff
overall
good
bc
didn't
know
anything
beforehand
was
challenging
course
-----
the
myriad
of
spelling
errors
in
code
assignments
and
even
exams
themselves
reflect
extremely
poorly
on
instructor
a
few
typos
are
okay
here
there
but
sheer
lack
effort
all
material
was
appalling
made
it
so
that
doing
homework
answering
questions
actual
exam
confusing
-----
easiest
class
and
prof
i
have
ever
taken
when
the
midterm
avg
was
90
she
gave
a
5pt
curve
bc
felt
we
had
to
write
too
much
didn't
so
got
101
on
exam
never
went
received
in
college
-----
class
is
pretty
easy
to
do
well
in
i
had
no
issues
at
all
and
was
able
gather
everything
needed
for
assignments
tests
on
her
website
so
barely
went
overall
super
nice
professor
-----
definite
easy
a
hws
are
really
simple--
the
examples
she
give
in
class
satisfies
hw
requirements
so
you
can
build
onto
those
exams
almost
exactly
like
practice
gives
extra
credits
for
and
directions
be
bit
unclear
sometimes
overall
take
her
gpa
boost
-----
sana
was
difficult
to
understand
both
in
person
and
on
her
website
for
the
class
grading
criteria
sometimes
didn't
make
sense
i
struggled
with
homework
had
learn
a
lot
through
online
tutorials
she
did
help
me
as
semester
very
lenient
but
enjoy
-----
not
difficult
enough
she
is
a
pretty
good
teacher
and
extremely
nice
but
everything
was
little
too
easy
compared
to
other
python
classes
i've
seen
i
would
do
the
hw
in
class
as
soon
it
assigned
-----
sana
is
a
great
professor
and
all-around
amazing
person
she's
extremely
understanding
to
any
issues
always
made
lectures
more
like
discussion
with
friends
rather
than
monotonous
lecturing
-----
a
very
unclear
professor
the
material
isn't
hard
but
she
makes
it
seem
that
way
asked
our
class
to
close
computersduring
computer
science
course
i'd
recommend
against
better
people
teach
this
required
for
comp
sci
majors
-----
amazing
person
but
one
of
the
most
boring
and
not
very
clear
professors
that
i
had
you
will
likely
find
yourself
learning
more
from
textbook
than
an
actual
class
-----
assignments
and
exams
are
difficult
but
is
heavily
curved
up
if
your
code
has
bugs
you
only
lose
a
few
meager
points
unless
it
absolutely
terrible
easy
as
for
the
teaching
it's
decent
-----
she
was
awesome
always
available
through
e-mail
if
not
in
person
and
grades
very
generously
even
though
says
takes
a
lot
of
points
off
is
teaching
computer
science
class
take
it
-----
she's
kind
and
zealous
however
she
seldom
manages
to
explain
her
assignment
well
though
tried
-----
professor
is
very
knowledgeable
and
explains
concepts
well
odeh
helpful
accessible
her
exams
assignments
are
hard
but
if
you
study
keep
up
with
class
work
will
be
able
to
do
wells
i
highly
recommend
classes
-----
her
style
of
teaching
is
too
fast
for
me
otherwise
i
think
ok
she
does
use
some
newer
techniques
but
keeps
old
as
well
especially
the
code
textbook
useless
and
not
necessary
has
office
hours
tend
to
be
busy
prefers
you
go
tutoring
or
ask
your
grader
tests
are
way
long
-----
easy
a
the
methods
taught
can
be
outdated
due
to
continuous
changes
in
java
development
tests
long
but
are
quite
simple
if
question
involves
coding
it
is
usually
very
similar
assignments
game
programming
assignment
easier
considering
just
group
work
no
presentations
short
-----
she
is
a
nice
prof
and
understandable
but
little
bit
outdated
makes
her
class
always
feel
like
teaching
just
several
active
student
tests
are
pretty
easy
generally
if
you
attend
classes
listen
carefully
-----
everything
she
teaches
is
pretty
outdated
in
a
computers-based
course
it
would
make
sense
to
keep
up
with
current
programs
and
tech
but
apparently
doesn't
realize
that
every
app
exemplifies
8
years
4
versions
too
old

-----
i
saw
such
great
ratings
of
sana
here
and
took
the
course
now
think
a
few
these
might've
been
written
by
herself
b
c
she's
not
as
nice
sort
condescending
at
office
hours
def
picks
favorites
she
really
loves
this
1boy
in
our
class
taught
us
arrays
like
last
two
days
expects
to
know
it
for
final
crazyyyy
-----
she
is
beyond
strict
with
absences
and
late
arrivals
her
class
mandatory
so
there
nothing
much
you
can
do
about
it
-----
being
boring
strict
and
arrogant:
anyone
can
have
two
of
them
still
be
a
good
professor
all
three
is
rare
talent
peggy
just
has
it
her
attendance
policy
beyond
understandable
the
class
content
nearly
useless
i
not
judge
as
person
but
classroom
experience
definitely
uncomfortable
-----
peggy
oh
she's
the
only
teacher
for
performance
strategies
so
at
least
you
will
have
a
bonding
experience
with
all
your
classmates
her
lectures
are
boring
really
easy
tho
my
suggestion
is
sit
in
back
can
just
go
on
phone
recitations
things
that
matter
because
she
doesn't
teach
them
-----
very
tough
on
attendance
however
if
you
just
show
up
and
do
the
work
you'll
pass
she's
definetly
a
bit
annoying
as
teacher
but
can
actually
learn
lot
from
her
class
-----
tough
on
attendance
but
a
good
prof
who
knows
what
she's
talking
about
some
people
don't
like
her
because
stickler
for
rules
it's
worth
it
to
take
-----
i
graduated
from
tisch
2
years
ago
and
was
on
their
site
almost
gave
back
my
lunch
when
read
which
teachers
have
been
given
title
distinguished
who
rates
them
-
childen
gormley
julie
sloane
susan
sandler
alice
elliott
had
the
misfortune
of
having
all
four
would
rate
similarly
horrible
-----
ugh
remember
the
nuns
you
hated
in
catholic
school
she's
worse
scary
dull
and
incredibly
strict
i
think
she
thinks
a
famous
actress
-----
this
women
is
dreadful
she
thinks
meryl
streep
over-rated
obsessed
with
marlon
brando
and
reminds
me
of
every
bad
teacher
i
had
in
catholic
school
spends
more
time
making
up
rules
then
teaching
seems
very
bitter
the
best
actress
world
talks
about
herself
constantly
-----
peggy's
lectures
are
incredibly
boring
and
useless
she
rambles
on
about
sidney
lumet
marlon
brando
her
personal
experiences
i
can't
name
a
thing
learned
in
class
but
it's
required
so
good
luck
-----
caring
teacher
but
doesn't
give
you
room
to
learn
on
your
own
or
discover
things
yourself
lots
of
in-class
exercises
as
well
not
my
favorite
tisch
prof
she's
still
pretty
good

i'm
impressed
by
how
little
i
learned
given
much
time
spent
in
this
class
unfortunately
it
is
required
and
she
the
only
professor
-----
yuck
this
woman
actually
gives
pop
quizzes
she
is
completely
self-centered
and
obsessed
with
marlon
brando
treats
you
like
your
five
boring
except
when
talks
about
herself
her
favorite
subject
don't
take
unless
are
forced
to
-----
i
think
peggy
is
very
misunderstood
sure
she
gets
angry
easily
and
calls
people
out
but
hey
was
intimidating
effective
the
lectures
didn't
stand
to
me
much
were
informative
speech
gave
on
last
day
of
class
most
inspiring
thing
i've
heard
since
came
tisch
if
every
ended
like
that
wow
-----
the
class
peggy
teaches
is
easy
however
not
if
you
arrive
even
one
second
late
she'll
give
a
ticket
fall
asleep
mark
your
grade
down
she
treats

like

all
ever

about
her
career

get
an
-----
as
you
can
see
peggy
is
a
very
divisive
professor
personally
i
didn't
like
her
thought
she
was
petty
arrogant
and
disrespectful
says
lot
of
stupid
stuff
about
writing
directing
at
the
same
time
certainly
knows
with
acting
actors
so
try
to
be
open
what
has
say
on
that
front
ignore
everything
else
-----
oh
peggy
this
course
is
extremely
important
in
the
directing
student
curriculum
and
ruined
all
interest
i
had
learning
about
anything
she
taught
her
constant
calls
for
class
to
be
silent
not
eat
look
at
each
other

after

knows
what
she's
talking
about
but
fails
to
connect
and
control
the
classroom
very
old
school
refuses
see
that
world
is
evolving
plus
one
of
those
professors
hammers
whole
artist
thing
down
your
throat
tries
convince
grades
et
cetera
don't
matter
*she's
an
actres
that's
important

-----
peggy
is
an
iconic
freshman
lecturer
everybody
respects
and
recognises
her
she
shares
wonderful
insights
into
the
industry
focuses
on
things

peggy
is
eccentric
though
sometimes
a
bit
impatient
with
her
classes
lectures
are
good
30
minutes
longer
than
most
feel
necessary
but
she
gives
great
insight
to
the
world

she's

full
of

this
is
really
an
amazing
professor
it
wasnt
up
until
the
second
to
last

i
finally
understood
what
he
was
saying

meaning
of
life
opens
your
eyes
different

and
leaves
you
amazed
highly
recommend
-----
not
very
understanding
at
all
he
appears
to
friendly
and
likable
during
class

the
inevitability
of
certain
events
zero
sympathy

rutigliano
is
an
amazing
professor
and
really
cares
a
great
deal
about
his
students
the
class
easy
but
he
makes
it
like
that
for
reason
knows
are
only
there
grade
yet
somehow
he's
so
inspiring
i
end
up
reading
every
book
assigns
during
my
free
time
best
prof
at
nyu
hands
down
have
taken
4
classes
with
him
-----
i've
taken
two
classes
with
rutigliano
and
i
dare
anyone
to
find
a
more
inspiring
innovative
professor
at
nyu
or
any
other
school
this
man
is
an
encyclopedia
he
knows
everything
the
same
time
understands
how
teach
things
in
way
that
makes
students
want
learn
you
will
love
his
class
him
promise
-----
easy
a
he
is
great
-----
he's
the
best
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
first
i
was
a
little
lost
he
has
this
adorable
accent
and
is
very
passionate
when
speaks
about
history
but
his
methods
approach
to
teaching
absolutely
wonderful
inspiring
definitely
makes
you
t
-----
rutigliano
i'm
sure
is
a
good
person
&
professor
but
as
an
advisor
he
very
hard
to
get
in-touch
with
maybe
should
give
up
the
advising
gig
although
at
it
-----
his
classes
were
fun
inspiring
very
knowledgable
but
also
haphazard
you
can
get
by
regurgitating
he
loves
and
inspires
when
bring
new
material
to
the
table
a
advisor
walking
prozac
-----
absolute
genius
ridiculous
knowledge
but
no
pretension
such
a
great
teacher
just
amazing
only
person
in
gallatin
[teacher
faculty
student]
that
i've
met
isn't
total
ass
-----
he's
the
best
professore
was
man
and
i'd
take
any
class
he
offered
-----
i
love
this
man
-----
he's
a
smart
guy
and
his
lectures
discussions
can
be
fun
interesting
but
the
class
itself
is
very
badly
put
together:
basically
just
regurgitate
what
he
says
in
on
tests
it's
kind
of
ironic
that
rails
against
phenomenal
thinking
outmoded
educational
system
yet
exactly
how
structured
-----
he
does
a
great
job
of
giving
students
taste
the
subject
his
classes
are
not
as
rigorous
they
could
be
but
an
entertaining
introduction
he's
incredibly
passionate
teacher
-----
professor
kellogg's
classes
are
known
to
be
very
easy
and
require
little
work
this
was
true
in
class
the
material
he
presents
lectures
studies
that
you
learn
about
interesting
relevant
my
main
problem
is
sometimes
says
things
kind
of
offensive
women
doesn't
really
realize
it
-----
easiest
a
and
it's
not
just
because
this
class
is
interesting
but
also
prof
kellogg
such
great
lecturer
who
cares
about
his
students
we
need
more
professors
like
him
at
nyu
you
run
very
labs
in
spss
with
your
peers
there's
midterm
based
on
terms
final
which
do
groups
overall
-----
you
can
take
this
class
for
the
content
but
expect
to
memorize
200
slides
every
exam
know
how
write
single
word
on
each
that
weighs
33%
and
don't
get
any
extra
credit
it
as
pass
fail
if
care
about
your
grade
great
information
horrible
structure
he
discourages
learning
encourages
memorization
-----
prof
kellogg
is
the
best
psych
professor
at
nyu
his
class
super
easy
and
he
allows
you
fix
all
labs
mess
up
on
midterm
exam
based
one
lecture
final
a
group
lab
assignment
just
show
&
try
will
get
an
even
has
extra
credit
opportunity
paper
was
tricky
but
manageable
overall
he's
amazing
-----
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
courses
i've
taken
at
nyu
if
you
end
up
taking
class
i
guarantee
that
will
learn
a
lot
about
drug
addiction
just
make
sure
you're
able
to
memorize
over
200
slides
since
your
exams
be
based
on
them
grading
criteria
pretty
simple:
2
out
3
best
determine
final
grade
-----
i
took
addiction
with
kellogg
there
were
3
exams
that
made
up
your
entire
grade
and
they
based
off
of
the
lecture
slides
put
online
if
you
memorize
then
you'll
ace
don't
have
to
go
class-
he
even
says
anything
in
class
won't
be
on
exam
only
lectures
are
interesting
but
not
imperative
-----
i
enjoy
the
class
but
professor
isn't
very
engaging
in
addition
his
exams
most
definitely
no
longer
take
10
minutes
each
exam
had
over
100
short
answer
questions
that
required
straight
memorization
from
200
slides
of
information
don't
this
if
you
want
an
easy
a
because
actually
have
to
work
for
it
now
-----
the
exams
are
all
short
answer
with
very
few
multiple
choice
so
make
sure
you
memorize
important
details
which
can
be
many
i
went
into
this
course
not
expecting
much
but
now
am
seriously
considering
doing
something
involved
addiction
treatment
in
has
really
changed
direction
of
my
life
thanks
professor
-----
this
can
be
an
easy
class
to
pass
with
a
good
grade
if
you
memorize
the
material
for
three
exams
i
don't
know
why
but
enjoy
having
in
morning
it's
interesting
topic
and
very
going
have
when
there
is
movie
documentary
almost
every
week
pertaining
drug
usually
full
too
-----
this
class
was
a
joke
i
never
skip
classes
but
stopped
attending
his
he
shows
movies
just
about
every
and
reads
off
slides
puts
online
all
of
exams
take
10
min
max
learned
almost
nothing
new
don't
know
how
can
paycheck
from
nyu
in
good
conscience
when
so
little
effort
teaching
-----
easiest
a
i've
ever
gotten
he
grades
the
labs
for
each
class
pass
fail
and
lets
you
redo
them
if
or
miss
it
exams
only
had
midterm
final
gives
cheat
sheet
which
has
25
terms
definition
to
remember
was
just
running
data
on
spss
took
less
than
30mins
-----
great
professor
easy
a
if
you
put
some
work
in
whoever
said
he
doesn't
care
is
****
this
guy
amazing
-----
attendance
is
not
mandatory
but
for
some
reason
the
class
full
everyday
especially
at
9:30am
this
rare
students
are
obviously
going
a
i
enjoy
early
in
morning
he
throws
jokes
sometimes
which
nice
very
easy
to
talk
and
covers
important
material
related
subject
-----
in
3
words
-
he
doesn't
care
the
final
exam
takes
15
min
to
complete
gives
a
cheat
sheet
of
answers
day
before
is
passive
aggressively
trying
hurt
nyu
by
not
teaching
anything
constructive
instead
his
students
watch
movies
got
from
hallmark
channel
fact
that
whole
class
gets
an
should
be
red
flag
suck
-----
taking
lab
in
psychopathology
with
him
now
this
is
the
second
time
i've
had
as
a
teacher
and
he
by
far
best
psychology
at
nyu
easy
but
interesting
fun
take
any
class
you
can
-----
i
love
him
think
he
is
hot
the
class
was
an
easy
a
tells
you
exactly
what
going
to
be
on
tests
and
majority
of
test
just
listing
terms
that
gives
in
one
thing
had
problem
with
sometimes
would
speed
through
his
slides
which
does
not
post
either
have
book
don't
go
or
-----
one
of
the
easiest
classes
ever
just
do
study
guides
night
before
so
it's
fresh
in
your
mind
and
you'll
get
an
a
prof
kellogg
is
funny
although
attendance
not
mandatory
you
should
go
for
his
stories
very
interesting
course
with
movies
-----
i
heart
scotty
k
you
must
take
this
class
guy
is
awesome
don't
let
people
ruin
the
and
complain
about
it
being
too
easyyeah
it's
easy
but
actually
wanted
to
go
a
large
detour
from
my
lack
of
attendance
in
other
classes
::coughs
social
psych::
-----
this
is
an
easy
a
class
minimal
stuying
involved
it
can
get
little
unchallenging
and
then
you
question
the
prof's
tenure
status
but
i
look
forward
to
having
him
in
small
setting
-----
best
professor
i
ever
had
there's
just
an
awesomeness
about
him
-----
honestly
not
an
easy
a
class
but
amazing
lectures
his
is
helpful
in
way
that
he
really
requires
us
to
understand
the
material
instead
of
merely
how
solve
problem
may
seem
confusing
at
first
you
will
likely
find
interesting
when
get
know
style
and
words
-----
bisin
is
probably
a
good
researcher
but
he
really
doesn't
know
how
to
teach
undergraduate
students
who
are
new
statistics
terrible
at
math
so
leaves
everything
the
conceptual
level
his
lectures
very
confusing
sometimes
gets
himself
lost
it
possible
ace
exams
you
need
self
study
lot
of
materials
-----
bisin
overall
is
okay
i
would
say
very
nice
guy
funny
and
cares
about
students
learning
make
sure
you
go
to
class
write
down
every
word
because
he
doesn't
by
the
book
will
test
on
what
did
in
if
have
seher
gupta
for
recitation
you're
lucky
all
of
them
she
amazing
taught
me
everythin
-----
do
not
take
his
class
he
is
a
very
nice
person
and
genuinely
cares
about
your
learning
but
that
results
in
him
caring
grade
extremely
vague
exams
tests
won't
tell
you
anything
you'll
have
maybe
2-3
questions
for
the
entire
midtermfinal
they'll
be
mad
hard
just
yourself
favor
avoid
-----
i'm
still
not
entirely
sure
why
nyu
has
such
great
intro
teachers
but
one
decent
intermediate
bisin
is
a
good
guy
he
will
challenge
you
and
make
work
hard
thinks
spending
5-6
hours
on
problem
set
which
you'll
get
every
week
the
norm
should
be
stuck
have
to
think
it
over
structure
of
class
weird
-----
curriculum
is
poorly
constructed
involving
jumping
from
topic
to
without
much
depth
or
explanation
lectures
are
unclear
bisin
frequently
goes
entire
explaining
even
the
basic
concepts
behind
each
problem
leaving
most
interested
students
lost
however
he
a
funny
and
interesting
guy
-----
he
has
no
book
for
the
class
this
is
not
an
introductory
but
instead
advanced
and
quickly
moving
survey
of
microeconomic
principles
topics
i
don't
understand
how
still
teaching
aside
from
tenure
research
contributions
arrogant
comes
off
as
unhelpful
-----
i
pay
attention
in
class
yet
learn
little
he
skips
multiple
steps
and
often
tells
you
more
about
what
will
rather
than
actually
teach
it
don't
know
is
important
things
are
taught
random
order
when
look
at
homework
sets
i'm
even
supposed
to
do
he's
a
cool
smart
guy
but
not
great
teacher
-----
bisin
gives
off
the
charts
interesting
lectures
they
are
not
always
directly
related
to
material
but
very
engaging
and
entertaining
he
is
kind
helpful
students
who
approach
him
can
come
as
a
bit
intimidating
at
first
great
guy
incredibly
make
an
effort
in
class
with
-----
bisin
is
not
a
great
communicator
or
teacher
making
the
material
difficult
to
understand
there
seemed
be
no
structure
class
and
many
people
lost
he
asks
little
of
his
students
though
it
easy
enough
get
good
grade
without
truly
comprehending
-----
bisin
moves
fast
very
classes
seem
scattered
and
material
can
difficult
at
times
but
it
makes
sense
if
you
keep
up
with
make
sure
you're
interested
in
the
subject
beforehand
-----
class
is
in
dire
need
of
a
real
textbook
prof's
notes
are
whimsical
unpolished
and
not
nearly
comprehensive
enough
basically
if
you
ever
don't
get
something
you're
screwed
-----
bisin
is
a
brilliant
economist
but
not
that
great
of
teacher
he
knows
and
understands
the
material
in
his
own
mind
language
italian
struggles
to
convey
principles
simply
students
however
would
be
much
better
if
asked
more
ie
its
possible
get
by
without
doing
any
work
-----
the
class
is
a
difficult
one
-
don't
take
it
if
you're
not
sure
about
whether
you
can
deal
with
amount
of
mathematics
in
i
changed
to
policy
track
after
he's
really
knowledgeable
guy
and
he
loves
what
doing
but
particularly
into
an
easy
approach
dives
right
assuming
everybody's
going
be
following
him
-----
okay
everyone
who
keeps
complaining
that
microeconomics
should
be
a
prerequisite
obviously
never
took
microecon
therefore
has
no
grounds
to
say
it
prereq
its
not
for
reason
if
your
good
at
math
you
will
do
well
in
this
class
regardless
of
prior
econ
knowledge
-----
very
intense
not
much
help
if
you
don't
have
a
background
of
the
course
-----
you
should
know
principles
well
and
be
familiar
with
basic
calc
the
economic
intuition
is
explained
in
class
but
it
might
go
over
your
head
if
have
no
econ
background
don't
spend
time
reading
outside
materials
try
varian
he
puts
suggested
books
on
syllabus
for
a
reason
he's
not
greatest
teacher
really
choice
-----
very
unorganized
but
interesting
class
little
homework
3
problem
sets
doesnt
really
matter
how
you
do
on
the
tests
and
because
he
gives
everyone
a
b+
unless
knows
who
are
likes
-----
extremely
interesting
class
material
is
well
presented
and
challenging
he
uses
good
examples
always
explains
the
intuition
behind
math
most
of
other
people
commenting
are
uh
lets
say
sissies
should
take
a
econ
principles
or
just
go
back
to
high
school
-----
he
can
not
teach
even
speak
does
reply
the
e-mails
you
learn
anything
from
lectures
is
prepared
at
all
-----
john
is
amazing
but
if
you
don't
have
a
good
ta
that's
going
to
work
against
he
puts
lot
of
emphasis
on
historical
context
over
literary
analysis
he's
usually
willing
allow
for
rewrites
and
retakes
midterms
-----
john
waters
is
certainly
the
best
professor
in
irish
department
this
class
challenging
but
provides
an
excellent
survey
of
history
and
literature
he's
amazing
speaker
you
will
learn
so
much
take
time
to
do
readings
get
something
out
-----
john
is
the
best
professor
at
nyu
you
will
learn
so
much
he's
also
just
as
disillusioned
if
not
more
with
frustrations
of
bureaucratic
academia
any
student
he
gets
it
lectures
are
invigorating
and
completely
tireless
i
aspire
to
this
man's
success
integrity
-----
course
was
taught
by
2
profs
-
this
one
less
knowledgable
than
the
other
rambles
a
lot
during
lectures
on
things
not
relevant
to
reading
slow
in
giving
back
papers
and
assignments
makes
of
non-pc
comments
w
o
realizing
-----
i
took
joyce
with
him
amazing
man
smart
knowledgeable
funny
and
insightful
could
listen
to
talk
about
for
hours
the
text
s
were
obviously
tough
he
empathised
our
pain;
class
is
not
weak
of
heart
one
small
thing
that
sometimes
has
trouble
returning
papers
on
time
all
in
great
guy
-----
phenomenal
professor
don't
let
the
tangential
lectures
deter
you
-----
very
knowledgeable
man
goes
off
on
tangents
for
most
of
class
i
usually
don't
know
what's
going
but
one
the
nicest
professors
i've
ever
had
really
cares
about
his
students
lots
reading
not
much
else
to
do
could
easily
fake
it
till
you
make
in
this
and
well
-----
waters
is
an
exceptional
intellectual
yes
he
can
be
vague
but
his
lectures
are
all
encompassing;
it
would
impossible
to
specific
ideas
and
sensations
chase
him
down
for
office
hours
once
you
meet
gives
full
attention
take
special
topics
courses
-
he's
fully
invested
highly
recommend
-----
amazing
lectures
you
will
do
well
in
this
class
as
long
the
reading
-----
he's
insanely
smart
but
his
lectures
are
all
over
the
place
he
tries
to
ask
a
ton
of
questions
so
that
you'll
think
about
what
you're
reading;
however
sometimes
it
leads
boredom
readings
and
tests
pretty
easy
-----
he
is
extremely
unorganized
the
class
basically
himself
talking
to
whole
for
80
minutes
without
any
notes
yeah
sounds
smart
right
but
you'll
have
a
hard
time
taking
and
grasping
his
ideas
-----
i
took
a
map
ccc
class
with
waters
he
goes
off
on
tangents
during
lecture
and
they
are
hard
to
follow;
however
always
responds
emails
held
extra
office
hours
when
needed
started
discussion
group
since
we
did
not
have
recitation
slowed
the
pace
down
allow
no
work
except
reading
my
favorite
freshman
so
far
-----
he's
brilliant
but
very
much
in
his
own
world
and
it's
hard
to
understand
exactly
what
he
means
say
is
bad
at
returning
emails
can
be
a
bit
disorganized
often
late
office
hours
i
did
well
on
the
midterm
though
i'm
not
sure
how
class
doesn't
have
lot
of
work
other
than
immense
amount
reading
-----
i
thought
that
this
would
an
interesting
class
as
the
other
comments
said
he
was
great
is
smart
but
rambles
and
goes
off
on
tangents
don't
understand
anything
happens
can't
wait
until
lecture
over
because
none
of
it
makes
sense
to
me
-----
you
will
have
no
idea
what
he
is
freakin
talking
about
-----
did
not
respond
to
emails
15
mins
late
every
class
and
made
us
stay
an
additional
15-20
never
handed
back
papers
sometimes
posted
the
readings
for
day
of
brilliant
but
avoid
if
you
prefer
open
communication
organization

experience

amount
of

too
steep
readings
were
enjoyable
easy
get
through
his
lectures
very
thorough
he
fun
interesting
-----
took
his
class
on
contemporary
irish
poetry
while
he's
a
great
guy
and
an
engaging
professor
he
is
totally
disorganized
most
of
what
we
read
was
photocopied
at
the
last
minute
because
never
ordered
books
so
it
hard
to
plan
ahead
unnecessary
hassle
get
elsewhere

class
would
recommend
-----
i
have
never
used
rmp
before
but
after
completing
peri's
emi
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
this
course
was
most
practical
that
taken
thus
far
at
nyu
and
being
said
there
dull
moment
ps
is
extremely
passionate
engaging
kind
supportive
tons
of
fun
she
helps
you
build
your
future
truly
cares
-----
professor
shamsai
had
her
for
media
&
entertainment
industries
in
stern
was
one
of
the
best
educators
i've
ever
she
is
very
passionate
about
material
explains
concepts
clearly
and
genuinely
wants
students
to
succeed
expects
high
engagement
inspirational
doing
so
i
can't
recommend
enough
-----
great
class
really
informative
compared
to
how
much
this
teaches
you
about
media
its
not
hard
at
all
and
def
worth
it
professor
did
a
job
bringing
real
world
examples
the
texts
-----
shamsai
did
a
great
job
teaching
the
key
aspects
of
m&e
industries
if
you
want
to
gain
good
understanding
these
this
is
class
it's
not
easy
but
ensure
all
students
have
background
they
need;
she
always
available
for
exam
prep
&
help
on
team
projects
i
now
work
in
media
use
learnings
from
often
-----
this
class
is
not
easy
especially
if
you're
like
me
and
don't
have
a
big
business
background
however
prof
shamsai
does
great
job
of
breaking
down
the
econ
sections
i
came
away
from
semester
with
understanding
broader
entertainment
industry
it's
lot
to
cover
in
one
she
understands
which
info
most
useful
-----
it
was
definitely
not
an
easy
class
to
do
well
in
but
professor
shamsai
is
very
fair
she
knowledgable
of
the
industry
and
makes
herself
available
her
students
final
project
meaningful
helped
me
learn
more
about
current
state
entertainment
make
sure
memorize
every
last
detail
on
those
ppts
-----
she
was
my
professor
for
media
and
entertainment
i
think
did
an
excellent
job
covering
the
basics
of
different
areas
industry
her
lectures
were
well
organized
if
you
read
case
studies
pay
attention
in
lecture
you'll
have
no
problem
this
is
a
great
class
you're
serious
about
-----
he
is
a
sweet
person
likes
his
students
and
enjoys
teaching
but
it
just
so
hard
to
understand
concept
ideas
often
repeats
lessons
people
seem
bored
during
the
class
really
gets
pissed
when
are
not
paying
attention
or
sleeping
pay
participate
-----
he's
a
sweet
guy
and
super
enthusiastic
but
i
really
think
he
has
no
clue
what
talking
about
sometimes
-----
i
had
him
for
the
summer
session
he
is
a
really
sweet
guy
and
good
teacher
if
you
listen
yes
can
be
confusing
but
clears
things
up
go
to
see
during
office
hours
people
do
not
like
this
class
because
actually
have
work
your
grade
-----
i
really
liked
him
he's
a
fun
and
nice
guy
also
he
knows
quality
writing
very
well
good
not
the
easiest
class
in
world
but
one
of
my
favorites
-----
this
was
the
worst
class
i've
had
to
take
so
far
it
boring
and
hard
he's
useless
as
help
-----
very
energetic
in
the
morninglikes
to
send
emails
before
8:00
am
on
weekends
kind
of
vague
his
helpfulness
woka
wokawoka
right
-----
loves
to
talk
but
can
be
vague
with
his
statements
very
enthusiastic
for
an
early
morning
class
biased
if
you
follow
suggestions
you'll
receive
a
better
grade
right
waka
-----
a
difficult
yet
fun
professor
he
is
bit
of
an
oddball
but
absolutely
loves
literature
and
writing
just
put
in
effort
it
will
pay
off
-----
do
not
take
this
sorry
excuse
for
a
professor
if
you
wish
to
enjoy
your
life
man
is
soul
crusher
dream
ender
and
ruiner
over
15
hours
of
work
on
my
essay
earned
me
an
average
grade
he
unfair
grader
biased
prick
who
only
values
his
own
pitiful
opinions
stay
away
from
want
improve
writing
-----
he's
absolutely
useless
a
very
biased
grader
he
is
cryptic
in
his
desires
and
vague
with
criticisms
makes
connections
so
obscure
even
philosophy
professor
got
confused
take
the
class
at
your
own
risk
-----
prof
mccormack
was
really
helpful
and
insightful
in
class
having
with
him
a
enjoyable
way
for
me
to
start
my
day
he
is
admittedly
difficult
professor
but
i
have
learned
much
from
feel
that
most
people
don't
put
effort
which
they
blame
that's
not
fair
loved
recommend
all
-----
loved
writing
before
attending
this
class
my
fall
semester
of
freshman
year
learned
nothing
and
did
not
improve
but
for
lack
effort
all
three
essays
received
the
same
grade
although
i
well
in
discussions
minor
assignments
biased
grader
looks
only
his
opinions
-
write
what
he
wants
you'll
get
an
a
-----
definitely
wants
his
students
to
feel
as
passionately
towards
the
subject
he
does
but
falls
very
short
not
mention
advice
is
most
cryptic
crap
i've
ever
heard--
when
asking
about
my
essay
only
thing
could
advise
me
do
was
let
essayists
be
string
of
popcorn
on
magical
christmas
tree
an
thanks
-----
we
get
to
see
a
strange
polish
movie
in
class
mccormack
also
makes
some
loose
vague
connections
between
various
texts
but
he
is
certainly
encouraging
enthusiastic
and
works
hard
us
engaged
the
material
as
well
he's
humorous
at
times
too;
serious
when
has
be
though
i
suggest
take
this
course
you
think
lot:
-----
totally
a
nice
guy
really
eager
to
help
might
confuse
you
sometimes
but
if
you're
persistent
he
can
actually
be
helpful
in
office
hours
on
time
his
class
pretends
nt
2
care
marks
u
down
4
it
most
enthusiastic
person
i've
eber
met
grades
harshly
-----
extremely
nice
guy
he's
really
enthusiastic
about
everything
he
wants
us
to
share
in
his
enthusiasm
as
well
i
feel
like
lacks
the
ability
truly
guide
is
a
bit
cryptic
wish
had
been
more
concrete
advice
insight
felt
lost
and
was
never
there
help
at
all
don't
improved
or
learned
much
-----
he
wants
to
inspire
his
students
write
but
just
can't
a
lot
of
writing
for
class
reading
and
is
harsh
grader
classes
are
boring
he's
nice
guy
-----
no
comments
-----
enthusiastic
and
good-hearted
not
the
greatest
listener
but
if
you
go
to
his
office
hours
calm
him
down
he
can
be
a
good
help
aren't
about
writing
i
think
you'll
have
problems
you're
interested
in
improving
great
despite
some
bs
now
then
he's
quite
an
intelligent
professor
-----
this
teacher
if
you
can
call
him
that
is
the
biggest
piece
of
crap
in
world
i
have
had
more
intelligent
conversations
with
coma
patients
than
he
by
far
worst
ever
not
helpful
fair
and
a
total
****
to
top
it
off
worse
malignant
brain
tumors
stay
away
-----
dr
fenton
is
a
super
nice
guy
who's
willing
to
hear
you
out
on
things
he
always
wants
his
students
do
well
the
class
pretty
difficult
for
core
but
really
don't
need
memorize
anything
exams
makes
about
broader
concepts
and
should
be
able
if
can
think
logically
-----
very
smart
professor
and
a
nice
guy
class
is
little
tough
for
core
subject
-----
this
class
is
dense
with
complicated
material
but
professor
fenton
works
hard
to
break
everything
down
for
students
he
really
wants
see
everyone
learn
and
pass
there's
a
generous
curve
throughout
the
semester
loves
having
ask
questions
after
or
during
office
hours
if
you're
struggling
seek
him
out
-----
don't
make
the
mistake
i
did
and
think
this
class
will
be
half
bio
psych
it
is
absolutely
pure
name
of
misleading
he
primarily
used
to
teaching
graduate
students
therefore
teaches
a
lot
complex
material
for
undergrads
horrible
at
explaining
stuff
his
office
hours
are
useless
take
him
-----
dr
fenton
doesn't
even
teach
from
the
book
he
teaches
based
off
of
research
he's
done
but
since
is
a
very
specific
part
memory
expect
final
to
go
way
too
in
depth
into
his
one
topic
while
not
really
covering
other
things
unbelievably
hard
tests
condescending
and
despite
what
lets
on
no
curve
-----
for
a
guy
that
has
to
teach
students
about
complicated
bodily
structures
he
does
good
job
his
lectures
can
be
bit
dull
simply
because
the
material
is
complex
and
sometimes
hard
picture
but
mixes
in
some
jokes
analogies
here
there
keep
attentive
he's
also
very
welcoming
really
wants
see
you
succeed
-----
read
the
textbook
before
lecture
then
do
lab
in
recitation
and
you
should
absorb
material
well
otherwise
it
is
very
dense
there
will
be
a
lot
to
cram
for
each
exam
as
long
stay
up
date
fine
pop
quizzes
somewhat
interesting
but
he
does
decent
job
presenting
-----
prof
fenton
is
very
funny
and
he
knows
how
to
make
the
classes
concentrated
on
his
topic
helpful
in
learning
explanation
best
i've
honestly
ever
seen
among
neuroscience
dept
-----
attendance
was
not
mandatory
and
i
did
go
to
class
except
for
a
handful
of
times
lab
do
most
the
readings
actually
watch
short
online
materials
find
someone
study
with
ask
your
ta
questions
it's
an
easy
if
you
lecture
can't
pull
at
least
b+
then
there's
something
wrong
-----
professor
fenton
is
a
very
bright
man
who
clearly
knows
lot
about
the
field
of
neuroscience
when
i
would
go
in
for
tutoring
students
tell
me
that
this
class
basically
simplified
intro
to
was
difficult
but
overall
if
you
read
book
will
do
fine
on
midterm
and
final
-----
andre
is
so
passionate
about
what
he
teaching
and
wants
to
ignite
a
passion
for
the
same
subject
within
all
of
his
students
fast
straightforward
lecturer
ready
answer
questions
if
you're
willing
ask
them
in
lecture
tests
are
easy
but
you
pay
attention
engage
will
be
okay
-----
the
teacher
doesn't
explain
concepts
very
well
in
class
so
be
prepared
to
rely
on
textbook
for
most
of
answers
pop
quizzes
happen
often
and
are
quite
difficult
-----
i
found
his
lectures
to
be
too
abstract
and
unclear
he
will
give
out
an
occasional
pop
quiz
when
sees
there's
not
many
people
attending
class
tests
are
a
bit
more
on
the
difficult
side
gave
us
option
drop
our
2nd
midterm
have
final
count
for
so
that
was
nice
passionate
what
does
just
isn't
best
teacher
-----
don't
take
this
class
core
science
classes
are
for
students
who
have
an
interest
in
was
way
too
difficult
a
and
the
professor
just
doesn't
know
how
to
teach
he's
very
smart
but
not
good
at
conveying
information
-----
if
you're
not
afraid
of
a
challenge
and
are
willing
to
study
take
this
class
it
seriously
changed
by
life
the
way
i
think
about
everything
professor
fenton
is
really
nice
guy
clearly
has
passion
his
area
-----
i
really
enjoyed
this
class
it
does
require
a
lot
of
work
especially
for
non-science
major
was
not
science
person
in
high
school
but
loved
learning
about
neuroscience
fenton's
if
you
are
interested
and
willing
to
do
the
textbook
reading
then
take
-----
originally
i
thought
this
class
was
going
to
be
more
psychology
based
unfortunately
it's
heavy
on
the
biology
never
good
at
science
so
very
scared
just
took
final
and
don't
even
remember
a
thing
honestly
suggest
taking
another
nat
sci
feel
rewarded
after
studying
hard
but
is
challenge
-----
this
is
by
far
the
most
difficult
class
i've
taken
as
a
non-science
major
at
nyu
so
much
reading
less
about
behavior
and
more
an
intro
to
neuroscience
tests
are
ridiculously
hard
i
found
myself
miserable
studying
for
than
any
of
my
others
labs
have
nothing
do
with
lectures
don't
take
-----
worst
course
and
teacher
puts
a
damper
on
your
gpa
the
resources
provided
are
useless
-
just
slides
with
pictures
no
words
them
he
claims
that
does
not
want
you
to
memorize
material
but
basically
need
know
whole
500
page
textbook
by-heart
if
pass
prof
was
condescending
unhelpful
-----
this
class
was
more
about
the
chemical
processes
of
brain
than
relationship
between
and
behavior
andre
attempted
to
be
a
good
prof
but
unclear
in
condescending
office
hours
tests
were
hard
tas
alright
labs
terrible
avoid
if
possible
-----
great
class
not
much
reading
or
homework
but
the
tests
do
cover
a
lot
of
information
get
ready
to
memorize
bone
names
still
i
would
recommend
forensic
anthropology
anyone
its
very
interesting
and
difficult
ridiculous
-----
lots
of
info
and
memorization
but
the
class
is
very
interesting
-----
prof
anton
is
amazing
she
a
woman
who
knows
what
talking
about
and
while
at
times
the
material
can
be
frustrating
like
memorizing
every
infra-order
sub-family
of
order
primates
i
enjoyed
second
lectures
gave
exams
were
tough
but
curves
really
nicely
as
long
you
exert
some
effort
you're
good
-----
do
not
take
thsi
class
for
core
credit
there
is
alot
of
information
and
three
really
unnecessarily
hard
tests
if
you
are
going
to
be
a
anthro
major
than
fine
you'll
learn
lot
she
preps
well
your
industry
but
this
won't
gpa
booster
unless
have
lots
time
study
-----
brilliant
professorbest
lecturer
i
had
at
nyu
was
pretty
resentful
about
the
amount
of
memorization
and
tedious
laboratory
work
but
taking
material
we
learned
changed
way
thought
world
can't
ask
for
much
more
than
that
-----
excellent
professor
extremely
difficult
class
she
expects
you
to
memorize
every
detail
for
the
exam
if
you're
not
an
anthropology
major
there
is
absolutely
no
need
or
reason
have
single
primate
species
but
she's
awesome
person
and
really
funny
-----
i
cannot
fathom
how
a
professor
expects
students
at
the
undergraduate
level
to
retain
so
much
information
anton
is
great
who
knows
material
well
but
her
exams
are
very
difficult
expect
memorize
1000
details
and
then
only
be
tested
on
10
-----
prof
anton
is
an
awesome
lecturer
and
makes
the
information
seem
really
clear
but
exams
are
a
different
story
as
long
you
know
that
they
will
be
lot
harder
more
detailed
than
lectures
make
it
youll
fine
labs
mandatory
tedious
-----
dr
anton
is
the
reason
i
decided
to
double
in
anthro
her
classes
are
definitely
tough
because
of
all
material
but
she's
willing
work
with
you
make
sure
understand
it
she
makes
class
interesting
and
expectations
pretty
straightforward
no
surprises
here
-----
she's
an
amazing
professor
for
human
evolution
i
learned
a
lot
and
had
of
fun
dr
anton
is
extremely
approachable
funny
the
labs
are
kind
hard
there
information
covered
but
if
you
have
good
memorization
skills
you'll
do
just
fine
-----
i
didn't
expect
there
to
be
so
much
information
prepared
memorize
the
characteristics
of
20+
species
labs
are
also
quite
difficult
tests
were
however
fair
professor
anton
is
very
passionate
about
her
subject
and
feel
lucky
have
had
as
a
just
get
ready
-----
awesome
teacher
great
class
to
take
for
the
required
natural
science
i
have
never
taken
anthropology
and
she
is
a
tas
are
-----
i
was
excited
to
take
this
course
based
on
previous
reviews
despite
doing
well
thoroughly
regret
taking
it
the
material
significantly
more
in
depth
than
had
expected
for
an
entry
level
class
and
professor
simply
did
not
help
make
clear
or
interesting
if
you
are
looking
fulfill
your
nat
sci
requirement
choose
another
-----
forensic
anthropology
best
professor
ever
funny
clearly
smart
engaging
learned
a
ton
you
need
to
definitely
study
hard
but
the
material
is
so
interesting
it
won't
matter
-----
awesome
professor
her
human
evolution
class
is
the
reason
i
took
on
a
double
major
in
anthro
currently
taking
forensic
she's
funny
engaging
and
reading
she
assigns
isn't
overwhelming
exams
are
tough
but
never
feel
unprepared
definitely
take
with
if
you
can
-----
i
took
her
for
intro
to
forensic
anthro
and
human
evolution
brilliant
funny
engaging
understands
students
our
needs
-
powerpoints
up
right
after
lectures
puts
sample
tests
before
exams
are
straightforward
she
is
the
perfect
professor
love
you
will
not
regret
taking
class
-----
by
far
the
best
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
-
anton
is
reason
i
changed
my
major
to
anthropology
she
a
funny
and
engaging
speaker
made
every
lecture
fascinating
exams
were
easy
if
you
studied
can't

i

the

very
good

with

interesting
&
great
take
-----
hands
down
the
coolest
class
i
took
at
nyu
cannot
even
say
how
awesome
thought
this
was
only
problem
that
it
really
hard-
but
totally
worth
-----
fred
myers
is
extremely
arrogant
and
self-absorbed
lectures
were
spent
just
talking
about
himself
showing
pictures
of
him
in
australia
most
readings
his
own
books
so
he
would
be
personally
offended
if
you
didn't
read
them
agree
with
everything
ta
will
make
or
break
your
grade
class
boring
take
a
different
c&c
-----
a
good
choice
for
core
culture
requirement
experience
depends
heavily
on
ta
there
are
4
four
page
papers
and
almost
all
the
reading
is
fairly
dry
class
itself
pretty
laid
back
you
don't
have
to
go
every
lecture
-----
fred
is
a
pretty
floaty
loose
lecturer
which
can
be
frustrating
in
course
without
much
structure
good
ta
this
class
real
thorn
your
behind
but
with
one
it's
breezy
the
entire
graded
on
4
papers
so
beware
gpa
if
you
muck
up
relatively
interesting
as
an
australian
boring
-----
fred
myers
is
very
passionate
about
what
he
teaching
and
quick
to
include
his
own
anecdotal
experience
of
australia
be
ready
read
the
books
assigns
all
but
one
which
are
dry
because
essays
based
on
lecture
recitation
will
help
you
understand
lectures
better
i'm
glad
i
took
class
learned
a
lot
-----
without
a
doubt
professor
myers
is
hands
down
one
of
the
chillest
professors
out
there
his
lectures
are
empowering
and
insightful
although
he
can
be
little
dry
sometimes
experience
knowledge
aboriginal
australia
simply
stunning
it
also
boils
to
large
degree
your
ta
but
if
you
participate
everything
will
turn
okay
-----
i
took
his
core
indigenous
australia
course
the
readings
were
easy
to
engage
with
and
papers
mostly
focused
on
films
so
lecture
attendance
didn't
really
matter
he
is
a
nice
guy
very
effective
what
grade
you
get
totally
up
your
ta
though
-----
this
class
is
one
of
the
easiest
cultures
and
contexts
you'll
find
while
i'm
not
very
interested
in
topic
prof
he
super
knowledgable
i
often
felt
bad
for
him
because
many
people
did
respect
but
he's
really
sweet
also
doesn't
have
any
midterms
or
finals
overall
grade
based
on
four
essays
-----
what
makes
this
class
is
the
ta
you
get
recitations
and
office
hours
always
answered
papers
for
me
actual
professor
a
nice
guy
really
wants
to
learn
about
his
passion
but
lectures
can
be
dry
there
crazy
amount
of
reading
-
only
third
which
actually
need
easy
if
put
in
effort
-----
every
essay
is
graded
by
your
ta
and
if
you
have
a
tough
one
this
class
will
not
be
cake
walk
don't
take
unless
you're
feeling
lucky
get
the
reasonable
good
which
rare
avoid
want
grade
even
work
hard
put
in
effort
like
i
did
none
of
that
matters
-----
gives
a
2-question
pop
quiz
from
time
to
graded
on
completion
i
think
basic
stuff
but
it
means
you
have
show
up
class
is
an
insane
cake
walk
3
papers
and
don't
really
do
the
reading
week-to-week
your
are
based
it's
too
dense
skim
last
minute
lectures
crazy
boring
you'll
get
good
grade
-----
talks
about
himself
a
lot
and
all
the
things
he's
done
with
pintupi
how
many
friends
he
has
down
under
essays
are
annoying
because
tas
not
helpful
them
at
they
vengeful
so
beware
get
on
their
good
side
-----
indigenous
australia
with
him
is
not
the
most
interesting
or
helpful
course
but
it
an
easy
just
a
bit
of
interest
and
participation
you
will
do
well
in
his
classes
even
though
learning
about
australian
aborigines
topic
i
like
listening
to
lectures
-----
this
class
is
a
piece
of
cake
i
am
actually
sitting
in
now
you
can
sit
on
your
computer
if
even
decide
to
go
no
midterm
final
just
3
papers
couldn't
have
been
happier
take
it
teaches
nothing
but
it's
easy
-----
interesting
sort
of
for
a
week
then
he
repeats
himself
the
rest
term
half
class
was
asleep
other
wasn't
there
three
essays
and
no
tests
tas
had
idea
what
to
talk
about
total
waste
time
-----
professor
myers
is
genuinely
interested
in
what
he
teaching
tends
to
go
off
on
tangents
but
into
the
class
with
right
attitude
and
interest
you
will
do
well
learn
a
lot
-----
professor
myers
is
straightforward
and
very
fair
in
his
grading
exactly
what
needed
a
map
course--
overall
enjoyable
-----
arrogant
and
annoying
told
the
same
stories
every
lecture
good
thing
was
that
there
were
four
essays
one
optional
no
tests
boring
reading
though
-----
i
took
world
cultures
australia
with
him
as
my
professor
and
it
could
have
been
much
more
interesting
he
is
kinda
intimadating
many
of
us
were
afraid
to
ask
questions
the
good
part
about
his
class
that
didn't
find
necessary
do
readings
there
only
3
papers
final
was
optional
-----
intro
to
aboriginal
culture
class
awful
but
no
need
go
lecture
tas
good
-----
no
comments

very
knowledgeable
speaks
clearly
funny
at
times
good
describing
the
harder
concepts
tests
are
fair
quiz
every
class
easy
based
off
previous
means
attendance
is
mandatory
but
you
can
just
walk
out
after
if
have
to
i
wouldn't
recommend
it
don't
sleep
on
this
pepsi-drinking
lumberjack
-----
dies
is
a
very
solid
teacher
he's
difficult
but
it
seems
appropriate
given
the
class
good
lecturer
who
can
explain
confusing
topics
with
precision
and

are
to
keep
you
on

i
met
-----
go
to
class
but
his
lectures
aren't
great
if
you
the
best
at
calc
or
visualizing
math
he
mostly
just
goes
through
examples
from
book
i
needed
a
lot
of
extra
help
understanding
concepts
struggled
in
is
very
kind
not
an
l
get
him
there
are
probably
better
options
-----
he's
a
good
lecturer
clear
and
concise
willing
to
help
with
problems
he
tries
his
best
make
you
understand
why
things
work

was
easier
than

curves
everyone
below
certain
grade
solid

would
take
again
for
future
math
classes
-----
pretty
fair
tests
although
i've
heard
he's
harder
than
other
professors
for
discrete
was
rough
an
8am
but
make
the
effort
to
go
classes
and
he'll
reward
you
gave
a
random
pop
quiz
that
write
your
favorite
number
down
would
take
again
very
clear
great
voice
-----
good
lecture
but
he
makes
the
homework
harder
than
other
instructor
as
far
i
know
two
sections
doesn't
have
that
much
nor
hard
exam
-----
took
it
over

incredible
industry

aviva
is
a
great
teacher

you're
allowed
to
miss
two
classes
and
you'll
have
homework
almost
every
week

master
class
doc
i
love
aviva
i'll
admit
her
personality
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
she's
pretty
fair
she
only
asks
that
you
not
be
late
and
care
about
the
subject
did
well
in
because
work
it
wasn't
hard
learned
a
lot
too
connected
this
-----
human
rights
in
documentary
was
a
great
class
each
is
film
screening
and
sometimes
guest
speakers
the
assignments
are
papers
grading
simple
aviva
doesn't
care
about
mla
formatting
she
cares
more
things
that
matter:
understanding
being
engaged
getting
something
out
of
than
just
grade
-----
i've
taken
several
classes
with
aviva
and
she's
amazing
she
can
be
a
hard
grader
at
times
because
expects
lot
but
if
you
love
documentaries
will
her
i
promise
never
received
anything
lower
than
an
a-
in
any
of
only
did
my
work
it
well
won't
let
slide
crap
papers
-----
i
took
all
three
of
aviva's
classes
and
was
continually
impressed
both
by
the
material
covered
thoughtfulness
aviva
cares
about
each
student
is
always
available
to
help
them
listen
she
one
best
professors
had
at
nyu
would
encourage
everyone
take
a
class
from
her
-----
disrespects
opinions
even
her
guests
sometimes
addressed
a
format
issue
with
my
paper
she
never
spoke
to
me
about
whole
class
w
o
naming
but
quoted
line
from
emailed
question
final
called
irresponsible
for
starting
it
2
days
before
due
really
got
done
i
an
a-
will
take
again
-----
prof
slesin
is
an
amazing
educator
she
cares
deeply
about
her
students'
ability
to
think
critically
the
world
&
encourages
them
look
beyond
docs
in
class
find
their
passion
then
question
everything
those
that
aren't
used
independent
thinking
prefer
easy
path
of
parroting
will
be
frustrated
classes
-----
aviva
believes
each
student
will
have
their
own
viewpoint
and
seems
to
respect
that
until
you
get
your
paper
back
her
markings
tend
only
allude
the
fact
she
doesn't
agree
therefore
grade
reflects
such
came
discuss
with
which
blurted
out
before
i
said
a
word
i'm
not
discussing
don't
even
know
why
-----
amazing
professor
one
of
my
favorite
at
nyu
she
took
a
personal
interest
in
each
student
-----
aviva's
class
taught
me
to
love
and
appreciate
documentaries
insight
the
films
their
construction
has
helped
immensely
as
a
filmmaker
her
passion
for
is
contagious
-----
i
switched
into
this
class
immediately
after
the
first
day
because
professor
she
takes
documentary
making
and
human
rights
seriously
but
her
goal
is
to
spark
each
student's
passion
interest
through
lens
was
an
eye-opening
would
recommend
all
my
friends
at
nyuyou
will
learn
a
lot
-----
she
is
very
unprofessional
throughout
her
course
told
me
that
my
papers
were
done
well
until
the
last
day
of
class
in
which
i
couldn't
write
at
a
college
level
and
would
pass
but
nothing
more
attended
all
classes
actively
participated
still
managed
to
be
horrible
teacher
person
-----
aviva's
strengths
are
in
the
love
she
shows
for
doc
films
and
great
high-profile
guests
brings
to
class
lots
of
in-class
discussions
there
was
a
3
page
paper
each
week
on
film
screened
as
well
two
8
papers
if
you're
interested
docs
or
want
learn
more
about
them
you
can't
go
wrong
with
aviva
-----
he
introduces
the
class
by
stating
that
this
will
be
most
important
in
our
college
curriculum
i
honestly
think
might
one
of
least
influential
classes
and
his
lectures
are
not
engaging
whatsoever
also
hasnt
given
midterms
back
its
been
over
a
month
hes
saying
they
released
few
days
every
week
-----
class
structure
is
4-5
essays
ranging
from
one
to
two
pages
and
a
critical
review
that
longer
it
advised
attend
because
we
go
over
the
sources
will
use
in
our
if
you
listen
what
he
says
can
your
essay
main
used
were
bible
source
book
rabbinic
stories
was
for
context
info
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
i
had
at
nyu
it
is
very
easy
to
do
well
on
essays
but
his
exams
are
a
bit
more
difficult
for
discussion
sections
definitely
choose
avi
miller
if
you
can
and
participation
important
he
tries
relate
class
real
life
experiences
really
makes
think
about
texts
-----
seems
like
a
great
funny
guy
and
that's
nice
all
but
the
class
sucked
his
lecture
style
seemed
really
rigid
lacked
giving
main
point
of
whatever
we
were
talking
about
it
was
clearly
required
that
no
one
wanted
to
attend
he
didn't
do
whole
lot
change
-----
awesome
teacher
he
made
lectures
extremely
interesting
that
being
said
there
is
a
lot
of
reading
and
you
should
do
it
all
attend
the
midterm
final
will
go
smoothly
seriously
to
if
what
tells
then
get
good
grade
in
class
learn
about
world
-----
rubenstein
is
by
far
the
greatest
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
i
him
for
jewish
ethics
and
then
again
texts
&
ideas
topics
we
discuss
are
interesting
he
makes
material
fun
inspiring
his
jokes
funny
class
goes
very
quickly
do
readings
won't
well
on
tests
or
in
recitation
without
them
-----
rubenstein
was
a
solid
professor
attendance
isnt
mandatory
and
i
didnt
even
read
half
the
texts
assigned
still
got
good
grades
on
tests
make
sure
you
have
notes
he
always
tries
to
people
laugh
with
corny
joke
but
all
in
decent
-----
professor
rubenstein
makes
the
concepts
he
discusses
palatable
and
understandable
it's
not
that
his
tests
essays
are
hard
per-se
but
sticks
pretty
rigidly
to
core
standards
of
grading
meaning
only
10%
students
get
as
25%
a-s
etc
in
my
year
curved
down
so
had
a
97
for
an
if
you
work
should
be
fine
-----
prof
rubenstein
is
a
solid
choice
for
texts&ideas
he
sympathetic
to
the
fact
many
are
only
taking
course
b
c
it's
required
and
attempts
make
it
meaningful
all
students
might
not
be
best
if
you
really
enjoy
subject
material
because
often
feels
as
dumbing
down
in
lectures
-----
professor
rubenstein
was
great
for
jewish
ethics
the
class
is
a
seminar
so
be
ready
to
do
lot
of
talking
topics
he
picked
were
interesting
and
did
job
leading
discussions
will
discuss
criteria
papers
in
easy
email
you
need
buy
some
textbooks
though
use
them
-----
professor
rubenstein
is
great
he
really
engaging
and
makes
the
topic
interesting
i
would
recommend
him
over
any
other
text
ideas
teacher
if
you
do
reading
a
participate
will
likely
well
-----
prof
rubenstein
was
one
of
my
favorites
i
absorbed
every
word
from
his
lectures
some
claimed
they
fell
asleep
but
love
reading
and
analyzing
also
he
threw
in
jokes
now
then
to
liven
up
the
class
:
-----
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
teachers
in
freshman
year
he
funny
and
always
prepared
with
some
sort
joke
or
story
the
class
is
not
hard
material
interesting
pay
attention
lectures
participate
recitations
-----
took
him
for
text
and
ideas
enjoyed
the
class
immensely
just
because
everyday
he'd
be
prepared
a
joke
would
come
into
to
try
make
everyone
happy
must
all
concepts
that
will
duplicated
in
wonderful
teacher
get
josh
schwartz
as
your
ta
if
you
can
-----
to
be
honest
i
wish
hadn't
done
all
the
readings
sure
it
might
have
been
intellectually
engaging;
but
any
student
who
was
able
rip
notes
off
of
class
could
ace
with
a
sparknotes
understanding
text
furthermore
this
fully
depends
on
tas
and
what
they
expect
from
you
go
take
get
concepts
-----
i
had
him
for
texts
&
ideas
attendance
is
mandatory
the
recitations
there's
a
good
amount
of
reading
but
he
splits
it
up
so
you
don't
have
lot
in
one
night
lectures
cover
material
-
missed
and
was
completely
lost
next
class
not
terrible
to
listen
exams
are
straightforward
-----
i
took
this
class
as
a
senior
my
advice
to
everyone
#1
get
the
out
of
way
early
ta
said
freshman
generally
do
best
in
#2
dont
readings
unfortunately
read
everything
and
its
not
tested
#3
apply
your
own
ideas
responses
he
looks
for
wrote
memorization
ie
lecture
material
&
handouts
-----
jewish
ethics
class
thought-provoking
and
pleasant
grading
especially
tough
participation
grades
can
be
killers
high
expectations
but
low
workload
-
so
measure
every
word
carefully
learned
a
lot
can't
hold
the
grade
against
him
overall
good
experience
very
prof
to
deal
with
-----
classes
are
actually
pretty
amusing
and
basically
hands
you
the
exams
ahead
of
time
but
there
is
way
too
much
reading
this
guy
thinks
that
only
to
learn
read
50
pages
a
night
i
didn't
single
thing
still
got
an
-----
con
west
was
pretty
good
for
a
required
class
though
recitations
sucked
mainly
because
of
the
people
in
it
all
you
have
to
do
tests
is
write
down
exactly
what
he
says
lecture
granted
i'm
little
obsessive
compulsive
and
almost
everything
very
enlightening
-----
human
societies&cultures
had
to
be
one
of
the
best
classes
i
have
taken
at
nyu
it
is
an
intro
course
and
workload
rather
heavy
but
when
you
commit
doing
all
readers
staying
engaged
during
lectures
recs
will
surely
love

prof
as
well
if
could
would

human
societies
and

is
one
of
the
best
courses
to
take
at
nyu
professor
rademacher
makes
class
both
fun
engaging
time;
her
passion
for
subject
truly
shows
through
lectures
which
are
amazing
though
it
can
be
difficult
there
lots
rather
dense
readings
i'd
highly
recommend
taking
-----
professor
rademacher's
lectures
are
exceptional
and
engaging
there
is
a
good
amount
of
reading
but
work
load
moderate
the
class
will
change
your
life
if
you
commit
to
connecting
with
very
relevant
material
expertise
advice
one
kind

this
chance

from
great
you'll
get
as
much
put
in
-----
extremely
lecture
and
reading
heavy
her
grading
criteria
was
never
made
clear
she
is
definitely
a
tough
grader
i
found
the
readings
lectures
to
be
so
incredibly
fascinating
even
at
9:30am
felt
unable
truly
display
my
knowledge
of
material
there
no
guidance
for
final
project
with
results
in
majors
stress
-----
i
only
had
one
class
with
prof
rademacher
but
wish
i'd
been
able
to
take
more
before
graduated
she's
easily
of
the
best
professors
at
nyu:
engaging
intelligent
and
actually
cares
if
her
students
are
learning
don't
expect
sit
back
not
talk
go
you
want
an
easy
a
she
grades
fairly
has
high
expectations
-----
she
grades
ridiculously
hard
and
is
unfair
in
my
opinion
does
not
explain
her
prompts
very
well
i
would
recommend
this
professor
at
all
gpa
for
sure
took
an
elective
course
-----
i've
had
professor
rademacher
for
2
classes
now
and
have
increased
my
knowledge
in
metropolitan
environmental
studies
tremendously
her
are
intellectually
rigorous
will
teach
you
mostly
how
to
think
critically
rather
than
what
exactly
prepare
be
challenged
rewarded
-----
professor
rademacher
is
an
extremely
sharp
insightful
instructor
that
challenges
her
students
with
rigourous
coursework
and
discussions
every
student
should
be
fortunate
enough
to
have
at
least
once
in
their
college
career
-----
i've
had
anne
for
2
classes
now
env

acting
locally
she's
easily
one
of
the
best
prof's
at
nyu
if
you're
a
social
theorist
don't
miss
opportunity
to
learn
from
with
her
she
will
challenge
you
and
has
high
expectations
but
is
also
extremely
fair
i
wish
more
profs
taught
like

the
lectures
are
excellent
some
of
best
i've
heard
at
nyu
and
r
brings
interesting
experiences
stories
writing
assignments
tough
&
you
have
to
keep
up
with
readings
but
i
learned
a
lot
great
class
-----
r
is
a
great
professor
she
obviously
loves
teaching
and
really
enthusiastic
about
urban
studies
there
lot
of
reading
but
it's
interesting
are
only
5
assignments
they're
difficult
so
utilize
the
amazing
tas
ask
for
lots
guidance
feedback
commentaries
if
you
do
all

-----
she
is
very
energetic
and
i
can't
decide
if
its
cute
or
annoying;
however
knowledgeable
has
had
many
experiences
in
the
field
lectures
are
mandatory
best
part
of
class
sadly
no
computers
for
notes

extensive
but
give
you
lots
to
work
with
commentary

5
total
which
brutal

the
essays
are
really
tough
and

dense

however
was
fascinating
even
if

were
often
useless
she
an
energetic
professor
obviously
very
knowledgeable
i'm
glad
i
took
must
be
on
time
attend
every
lecture
-----
there
is
indeed
much
text
to
cover
in
this
class
but
for
the
most
part
they're
straightforward
readings
she
does
not
summarize
lecture
instead
provides
us
with
some
background
on
topic
which
i
found
helpful
final
a
set
of
essays
beware
pop
quizes
-----
too
much
reading
in
little
time
the
class
should
really
be
discussion
based
but
all
she
does
is
lecture
at
us
-----
seems
a
little
unsure
of
herself
at
first
but
after
couple
classes
she's
great
lecturer
she
knows
her
stuff
and
done
really
interesting
work
which
brings
stories

extra

great
professor;
yale

she
is
probably
the
most
helpful
professor
you
will
find

was
easy
as
long
kept
up
with

somewhat
-----
great
professor
seems
a
bit
boring
at

becomes
much
more
comfortable

even

very
good
professors
help

a

well
in
the

follow
closely
with

-----
kleeman
always
has
office
hours
to
help
students
who
don't
understand
material
is
very
kind
his
lectures
end
early
and
they
do
move
a
bit
fast
so
you
may
need
read
the
textbook
sometimes
hw
worth
40%
midterm
20%

normally
everyone
does
well
on

based
off

professor
kleeman
always
ends
class
at
least
30
minutes
early
quizzes
are
easy
and
webassign
is
tedious
homework
tends
to
be
very
tough
the
formatting
all
over
place
--
don't
look
like
midterm
which
doesn't
final
but
that's
a
curriculum
choice
-----
professor
kleeman's
lectures
are
mostly
straight
from
the
textbook
he
explains
theorems
and
proofs
followed
by
one
or
two
examples;
his
always
end
early
but
that
does
not
mean
skips
anything
attendance
is
a
small
part
of
your
grade
available
during
office
hours
quizzes
pretty
easy
tests
very
reasonable
-----
a
very
charming
man
his
midterms
are
easy
he
allows
cheat
sheet
to
exams
and
you
could
write
anything
on
them
i
never
went
lecture
got
an
the
final
is
kind
of
difficult
but
because
its
departmental
written
assignments
slightly
there
few
no
pop
quizzes
lectures
end
45m
early
-----
mostly
organized
lectures
that
almost
always
end
early
but
are
rather
boring
sometimes
his
examples
can
be
unclear
usually
the
textbook
help
allows
for
a
page
of
notes
during
midterm
and
final
grades
fairly
if
you
don't
show
up
make
sure
to
have
friend
who
will
take
or
willing
read
-----
ends
his
lectures
up
to
45minutes
early
and
teaches
almost
exactly
from
the
textbook
only
few
homework
assignments
quizzes
midterms
are
fair
he
allows
a
sheet
of
notes
for
both
examples
gives
in
class
clear
but
there
aren't
lot
them
attendance
is
part
grade
very
helpful
when
you
need
extra
explaining
help
-----
professor
kleeman's
class
was
super
tough
but
that
seems
to
just
be
a
characteristic
of
the
nyu
math
department
in
general
he
definitely
knows
what
he's
talking
about
and
is
pretty
good
at
communicating
his
students
always
ends
lectures
early
doesn't
mean
you're
missing
out
on
material
has
it
all
planned
-----
take
this
professor
he
is
amazing
and
very
clear
with
his
lectures
learned
so
much
in
class
keeps
you
engaged
most
of
the
time
it
not
hard
to
pay
attention
also
always
ends
early
which
best
definitely
him
-----
kleeman
is
an
awesome
professor
he
understands
the
material
can
be
tough
and
usually
grades
accordingly
it's
also
nice
that
he's
super
organized
always
has
a
lecture
planned
out
beforehand
-----
good
professor
teaches
out
of
the
book
but
pretty
clear
and
helpful
in
his
lectures
if
you
ask
for
help
he'll
give
it
he
grades
fair
my
opinion
-----
chillest
professor
ever
lets
class
out
very
early
most
of
the
time
not
a
lot
homework
work
load
is
manageable
exams
are
fair
highly
recommend
him
-----
the
questions
this
guy
gives
for
everything
are
easy
as
heck
there
was
one
problem
that
badly-posed
but
he
gave
us
a
lot
of
points
on
overall
great
professor
chill
and
doesn't
assign
homework
very
often
it's
when
does
leaves
room
self-study
exploration
ends
class
early
-----
i
had
him
for
linear
algebra
excellent
professor
presented
organized
easily
understandable
lectures
and
gave
very
little
homework
-----
charming
and
ends
class
early
but
the
positives
stop
there
assigns
most
annoying
problems
for
homework
which
will
not
save
you
on
his
tests
anyway
grades
down
trivial
things
too
teaches
out
of
book
makes
no
difference
if
show
has
syllabus
be
amazed
how
hard
this
guy
can
make
calculus
i
-----
i
really
don't
understand
why
this
professor
is
rated
so
lowly
he
certainly
isn't
that
bad
a
teacher
or
hard
of
one
thought
was
very
fair
while
he's
not
the
most
helpful
wasn't
terrible
either
-----
he
teaches
more
or
less
straight
from
the
book
i
really
wish
didn't
have
him
for
calc
iii
don't
feel
like
got
anything
out
of
it
-----
all
he
does
is
read
straight
from
the
book
don't
bother
going
to
class
it
won't
help
you
understand
homework
40%
of
grade
but
very
difficult
final
60%
and
even
more
if
have
a
choice
between
jumping
off
top
floor
bobst
taking
his
jump
-----
this
man
has
no
interest
in
teaching
he
makes
that
very
clear
helping
the
students
doesn't
give
a
syllabus
or
regular
homework
and
your
whole
grade
is
based
on
one
completely
unfair
test
avoid
like
plague
-----
foley
is
a
teacher
that
will
force
the
work
out
of
you
if
are
not
ready
to
ie
write
read
and
some
more
he
probably
won'
be
great
choice
for
also
there
were
many
times
when
i
was
confused
with
criteria
but
does
conferences
each
essay
they
extremely
helpful
overall
eye-opening
experience
my
growth
-----
david
is
very
accessible
outside
of
class
and
will
give
you
extra
hope
if
want
to
it
the
homework
although
more
than
usual
helps
in
end
when
were
constructing
essay
drafts
amazing
professor
-----
okay
heres
the
deal
yes
theres
homework
but
it
kinda
therapeutic
to
write
in
a
starbucks
nearby
its
not
even
lot
all
people
commenting
are
slackers
you
can
easily
finish
an
essay
over
weekend
without
stressing
because
he
gives
really
good
feedback
and
individual
attention
sometimes
class
is
bore
hes
great
pls
take
-----
david
foley
is
a
wonderful
professor
he
gives
you
good
notes
on
essay
drafts
that
help
develop
your
ideas
more
thoroughly
the
exercises
we
do
in
class
are
very
helpful
and
they
not
just
busy
irrelevant
work
i
have
grown
so
much
as
writer
his
amazing
definitely
recommend
-----
-will
make
you
a
better
writer
but
you're
gonna
have
to
actually
try
-do
all
the
assignments
and
hit
requirements
for
your
paper
you'll
be
fine
-participate
every
now
then
-bit
of
stickler
on
attendance
if
reach
out
about
illness
he's
bit
flexible
-nice
will
give
bad
grade
don't
do
work
-----
go
in
ready
to
learn
don't
feel
bad
when
he
tells
you
know
as
much
thought
he's
right
the
only
way
do
well
is
participate
and
all
assignments
no
bsing
your
through
very
flexible
with
late
&
missing
class
provided
have
a
good
reason
are
participating
will
challenge
-----
after
starting
my
second
semester
with
a
new
teacher
i
realized
how
much
bs
work
we
had
to
do
in
his
class
the
stuff
did
was
for
most
part
waste
of
time
and
homwork
can
sometimes
take
forever
feel
like
grew
lot
as
thinker
not
so
writer
though
-----
too
much
work
this
class
is
taking
up
a
good
3
4
of
my
weeks
time
and
almost
irrelevant
to
what
i
came
study
here
means
well
but
just
stresses
depresses
-----
you
definitely
need
to
put
some
effort
into
this
class
but
he
is
an
amazing
teacher
and
really
helpful
wants
learn
become
a
better
writer
critic
i
learned
so
much
in
recommend
him
any
student
who
serious
about
their
education
voice
the
world
great
-----
foley
is
a
stereotypical
english
professor
who
believes
everything
he
says
incredibly
profound
and
complexly
interesting
generally
known
as
one
of
the
worst
writing
essay
teachers
at
nyu
but
surprisingly
forgiving
grader
i
was
stuck
with
him
for
both
semesters
it
not
good
time
-----
ok
so
david
foley
is
bae
if
you
actually
make
an
effort
and
engage
yourself
will
grow
much
need
to
give
him
want
anything
he's
witty
sweet
clever
i
am
basically
in
very
deep
platonic
love
with
have
incredible
conversations
amazing
can't
even
swear
-----
david
foley
is
the
worst
i
was
taking
his
class
while
struggling
with
depression
and
anxiety
he
upped
that
confusing
advice
inconsiderate
attitude
it
did
not
help
having
him
at
8
in
morning
talked
down
to
students
very
helpful
contradictory
made
us
hate
an
already
notorious
even
more
-----
he's
well
meant
but
doesn't
teach
that
instead
trying
to
focus
on
developing
the
student's
thinking
this
work
because
he
overloads
amount
of
assigns
which
if
you're
develop
your
writing
you
just
end
up
spitting
out
irrelevant
exercises
and
then
failing
final
papers
-----
this
guy
is
super
into
his
own
intellectualism
every
single
thing
that
came
out
of
mouth
was
vague;
nothing
in
class
made
any
sense
whatsoever
he's
very
particular
about
little
details
don't
matter;
for
instance
he
refused
to
accept
an
essay
because
i
didn't
use
the
right
kind
folder
do
not
take
-----
sohe
is
actually
a
kind
and
caring
guy
he's
pretty
flexible
but
don't
push
it
he
so
confusing
my
exercises
didn't
help
me
get
to
final
essay
the
in
class
prompts
were
not
helpful
always
asks
what
are
implications
of

one
hates

-----
he
was
a
great
teacher
challenging
yet
always
there
to
help
-----
he's
a
cute
old
man
that
walks
into
class
in
matching
suit
english
hat
and
cane
but
because
very
traditional
gives
boring
lectures
he
cannot
hear
or
see
well-yelling
at
him
works
d

seem
to
comprehend
students'
questions
does
not
give

it's
an
easy
don't
take
bc
i
didn't

this
class
is
an
easy
a
as
long
you're
willing
come
to
&
do
absolutely
nothing
be
nice
and
smile
he's
very
old

notes
for

-----
one
word:
old
although
i'm
sure
he
can
teach
the
material
i
feel
as
though
his
age
poses
a
major
problem
when
it
comes
to
students
learning
appreciate
assignments
are
decent
however
grading
be
bit
strange
managed
b
but
that's
only
because
learned
how

myself
honestlyjust
take
another
professsor
-----
such
a
boss
he's
the
most
old
man
i've
ever
met
take
him
so
cool
if
you
ask
he'll
tell
war
stories
from
past
and
then
do
really
funny
impression
of
nicholas
cage
-----
professor
bell
was
probably
a
great
at
some
point
but
now
he's
much
too
old
and
ill
to
teach
effectively
he
assigns
huge
portions
of
readings
each
class
goes
over
after
3
papers
mid-term
final
-
fairly
easy
grader
if
you
just
reiterate
points
made
in
his
lectures
-----
i've
studied
this
type
of
material
for
years
and
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
--
but--
as
knowledgeable
he
class
put
me
sleep
i
almost
never
read
anything
beyond
papers
walked
away
with
an

you
knew
why
got
your
grade
but

my
attendance
latter

above

professor
bell
is
a
great
guy
yes
he
boring
i
fall
asleep
in
class
all
the
time
but
goes
over
material
so
although
does
assign
lot
of
reading
you
don't
have
to
do
anything
charges
that
will
mark
down
for
disagreeing
with
him
flat
wrong

and
lowest
grade
on
any

easy

he's
a
nice
guy
and
all
but
not
clear
at
he'll
ask
for
your
interpretation
then
downgrade
you
because
is
wrong
according
to
his
views

him

very
funny
nice
and
encouraging
you
can
get
by
without

because
he
goes
over
them
-----
i
love
this
professor
he
evokes
insights
out
of
the
student
and
class
is
easy
as
hell
all
you
have

-----
bell's
grading
can
be
very
unfair
he
never
explains
how
grades
gives
clear
guidelines
on
assignments
and
exams
we
know
what
expects
admits
does
not
the
answer
to
questions
just
****s
no
one
talks
about
take
his

a

of
people
get
b-
or
c
-----
he's
really
into
the
subject
and
i
like
it
when
he
goes
off
historical
tangents
because
they're
very
interesting
only
thing
is
that
book
are
but
talks
a
lot
about
their
socio-political
background
same
for
of
books
got
repetitive
-----
the
class
is
quite
tough
and
he
expects
a
lot
from
his
students
but
you
do
learn
also
writing
assignments
are
not
really
clear
which
can
be
frustrating
overall
get
out
of
what
put
into
it
-----
a
great
teacher
he
pushed
all
his
students
to
think
without
being
pretentious
or
condescending
i
got
lot
out
of
class
and
would
recommend
anyone
-----
nice
older
guy
learned
a
lot
makes
ya
think
-----
i
was
uncertain
about
taking
an
anthropology
class
at
first
but
ended
up
loving
it
there
are
a
lot
of
readings
few
dry
or
annoying
to
get
through
while
the
paper
prompts
can
be
vague
summarizing
relevant
aspects
got
me
every
time
professor
schieffelin
is
great
talk
and
her
knowledge
impressive
-----
prof
schieffelin
is
an
extremely
harsh
grader
i
tried
everything
to
make
her
happy
but
still
did
not
receive
a
grade
that
worked
hard
for
there
no
clear
criteria
papers
so
beware
she
will
be
specific
about
what
ultimately
looking
class
interesting;however
room
individual
creativity
-----
i've
been
bamboozled
this
isn't
a
language
class
if
you
sign
up
for
it
thinking
will
be
think
again
-----
bambi
is
by
far
my
favorite
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
although
she
expects
a
lot
from
her
students
both
amount
and
difficulty
of
reading
but
also
paper
wise
criticism
feedback
beyond
helpful
for
developing
your
writing
skills
not
only
class
in
the
fields
anthropology
sociolinguistics
as
whole
-----
took
this
as
a
seminar
last
semester
and
i
will
say
there
are
highs
lows
the
class
is
long
about
25
hours
but
only
once
week
bambi
an
amazing
teacherthe
material
great
overall
really
rewarding
however
her
assignments
incredibly
vague
so
suggest
meeting
with
at
least
to
get
feel
of
what
she
wants
-----
her
class
is
an
easy
a
as
long
you
skim
the
readings
and
are
decent
writer
she
assigns
lot
of
essays
but
most
them
just
summaries
reading
materials
therefore
simple
to
complete
she'll
email
ask
where
were
if
miss
so
have
attend
overall
fairly
strict
i
enjoyed
-----
as
someone
here
already
mentioned
the
class
is
more
focused
on
anthropology
than
linguistics
but
we
do
have
'language'
components
sometimes
readings
are
really
long
and
you
to
mandatory
not
graded
study
questions
for
them
each
week
assignments
grading
vague
if
work
then
should
be
fine
-----
passionate
about
class
material
but
extremely
ambiguous
when
it
comes
to
assignment
directions
and
grades
harshly
you
don't
guess
what
she
was
looking
for
workload
is
dense
with
6-8
page
essays
each
week
in
addition
100+
pages
of
reading
study
questions
unless
you're
ready
devote
the
semester
anthropology
avoid
-----
she
is
an
alright
professor
if
you
think
her
class
about
language
again
more
of
anthropology
course
assigns
a
ridiculous
amount
reading
each
week
and
work
that
checked
but
not
graded
so
you're
basically
up
all
night
to
get
it
done
for
nothing
want
have
life
don't
take
this
-----
you
will
never
have
free
time
6-8
page
paper
due
the
second
week
of
class
and
fifth
sixth
etc
150-200
readings
every
is
25
hours
also
don't
be
fooled
by
course
nameit
not
a
language
or
linguistics
course;
it
an
anthropology
intense
for
first-semester
freshman
-----
she
is
one
of
the
nicest
and
most
helpful
professors
only
drawback
that
assigns
so
much
work
if
you
wanna
have
a
life
don't
take
her
class
or
never
finish
-----
the
worst
teacher
i've
had
at
nyu
not
clear
about
assignments
and
does
encourage
original
thought
in
only
summaries
of
text
she's
very
nice
as
a
person
but
she
is
an
engaging
readings
are
awful
this
class
complete
waste
money
time
i
am
so
bummed
didn't
switch
out
immediately
-----
the
course
was
great
laid
back
yet
well
instructed
bambi
is
truly
cool
reasonable
helpful
and
dedicated
to
her
study
she'll
make
you
love
language
inspire
learn
more
fair
grader
ta
chantal
white
they
were
an
awesome
team
-----
bambi
is
the
love
of
my
life
she
seriously
best
professor
teacher
i
have
ever
encountered
her
classes
are
challenging
but
definitely
there
to
help
everyone
understanding
fun
and
pretty
much
coolest
educator
on
this
planet
take
class
you
def
won't
regret
it
-----
bambi
is
wonderful
her
classes
are
interesting
and
she
very
laid
back
has
a
ton
of
experience
there
lot
work
but
it
isn't
that
bad
if
you
do
the
readings
study
questions
papers
will
be
super
easy
all
in
this
class
most
it's
my
favorite
i
am
doing
better
than
any
other
great
prof
-----
i
love
bambi
the
workload
for
her
class
is
pretty
big
but
she's
very
lenient
and
understanding
about
late
assignments
she
will
always
take
homework
by
e-mail
or
after
due
date
as
long
you're
honest
it
a
great
professor
-
really
knows
what
talking
cares
students
-----
be
prepared
to
do
a
ridiculous
amount
of
work
she's
very
nice
but
doesn't
care
if
your
swamped
or
have
tons
homework
every
class
you
will
spend
all
free
time
doing
her
-----
i've
had
bambi
twice;
she's
always
been
caring
and
lenient
classes
are
fun
never
stuffy
a
midterm
or
final
with
her
but
be
prepared
to
do
quite
bit
of
reading
writing
nevertheless
if
you're
interested
in
taking
linguistic
anthro
i
reccomend
over
anyone
else
-----
todd
is
a
really
interesting
professor
an
all
star
at
the
top
of
world
i
honestly
sit
in
awe
watching
this
legend
work
but
half
time
some
stuff
he
says
very
hard
to
follow
youll
either
love
him
or
struggle
class
his
grading
criteria
not
clear
and
when
hes
made
up
mind
thats
it
so
be
good
-----
not
a
very
easy
class
in
my
opinion
for
life
sciences
requirement
pretty
depth
raw
averages
on
exams
are
the
mid
60's
range
and
questions
really
specific
no
words
slides
10
pop
quizzes
throughout
term
-----
took
this
for
cas
life
science
requirement
-
good
choice
if
you're
not
great
at
material
can
be
boring
times
but
it's
relevant
and
exams
are
fairly
easy
labs
provide
a
opportunity
to
raise
your
grade
disotell
also
frequently
tells
funny
anecdotes
which
relate
the
-----
he
is
really
awesome
i
like
his
lectures
and
style
of
teaching
but
if
you
are
not
super
interested
in
anthropology
don't
take
class
a
blow
off
science
its
actually
pretty
tough
tests
all
short

as
puts
it

great
professor
really
enjoyed
the
class
definitely
geared
for
students
who
are
interested
in
being
anthropology
majors

was
difficult
suggest
studying
hard
his
tests
otherwise
classes
interesting
and
you
learn
a
lot
highly
recommend
to
any
anthro
major

he
is
really
intelligent
and
knows
his
stuff
however
not
a
fair

ambiguous
if

took

and
hope
to
take
any
of
his

courses
i
can
get
into
next

he
is
hands
down
the
best
professor
i've
had
at

him
so
funny
intelligent
interesting
he
plays
the
daily
show

in

he's

a

-----
i
loved
professor
disotell's
class
had
him
for
human
evolution
and
it
was
my
favorite
the
semester
took
he's
really
funny
lectures
were
entertaining
exams
a
bit
hard
but
if
you
pay
attention
during
review
study
enough
they're
fine
-----
disotell
is
about
as
good
it
could
get
in
a
nat
sci
class
he's
entertaing
sometimes
and
seems
real
nice
midterm
comes
out
of
nowherelectures
are
difficult
to
through
overall
too
depth
for
map
if
you
don't
have
interest
the
topic
i'd
say
take
different
but
this
one
isn't
awful
-----
disotell
is
amazing
i
think
he
absolutely
the
best
his
lectures
are
soo
clear
and
so
well
structured
knows
exactly
what
he's
saying
how
to
explain
it
heard
good
things
about
harrison
was
upset
that
had
take
but
i'm
glad
in
disotell's
section
excited
taking
class
next
semester
-----
definitely
the
coolest
professor
i've
ever
had
a
fun
guy
and
makes
lectures
interesting
explanations
are
usually
very
clear
he
also
has
mohawk
great
taste
in
music
can
be
taken
as
natural
science
ii
requirement
for
gsp
although
it's
cas
class
not
that
hard
labs
involve
little
bit
of
work
but
still
worth
it
-----
he's
not
a
bad
professor
in
fact
pretty
good
he
does
tend
to
oversimplify
things
but
is
very
amusing
listen
and
seemed
genuinely
want
help
those
who
cared
at
all
about
the
subject
yeah
you
really
didn't
have
come
class
which
was
quite
wonderful
-----
very
informative
and
creative
slideshow
presentations
really
dense
reading
can
be
rather
dry
boring
at
times
awesome
mohawk
monkey
shirts
-----
he
is
such
a
brilliant
teachermaybe
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
had
his
lectures
are
very
clear
and
informative
only
thing
that
tests
difficult
since
questions
all
short
answers
no
mc
so
basically
u
to
memorize
whole
book
overall
recommend
this
professor
-----
this
is
the
best
lecture
class
i've
ever
taken
-
funny
well-designed
interesting
disotell
wants
to
see
everyone
do
well
and
he
succeeds
in
simplifying
very
complicated
information
without
making
it
dry
irrelevant
made
mitosis
can
anything
plus
has
a
mohawk
-----
i
hated
biology
before
took
this
class
now
only
hate
parts
of
it
lovingly
dubbed
'monkeys
and
cavemen'
he
is
an
engaging
professor
who
really
knows
his
stuff
likes
the
simpsons
felt
approachable
did
mention
even
if
quotes
in
incorrectly
yes
-----
take
any
class
w
this
prof
he
is
brilliant
no
nonsense
and
an
outstanding
source
of
scientific
current
events
information
-----
elaine
was
honestly
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
ever
had
her
class
structured
so
that
there
a
small
amount
work
due
every
and
attendance
enforced
but
no
wanted
to
miss
because
it
fun
enlightening
she's
brilliant
cares
about
students
more
than
any
bureaucratic
nyu
nonsense
-----
horrible
teacher
i
don't
know
how
she
can
call
herself
an
educator
most
people
in
the
major
who
have
taken
her
courses
come
out
angry
confused
and
not
having
learned
anything
there
are
many
other
professors
at
nyu
intelligent
care
about
students
if
you're
thinking
of
taking
class
on
some
mistaken
notion
reconsider
-----
one
of
my
favorite
professors
at
nyu
great
sense
humor
down
to
earth
and
comes
up
with
interesting
fun
topics
for
papers
had
her
britlit2
she
was
able
make
a
survey
course
enjoyable
would
definitely
take
class
again
freedgood
doesn't
put
disrespectful
or
lazy
students
don't
expect
sleep
through
lecture
-----
not
a
class
you
can
slack
off
in
she
does
have
temper
sometimes
and
i
agree
that
once
get
on
her
bad
time
it's
hard
to
it
just

what
a
disappointment

devolved
into
power

the
professor
continually
criticizing

were
vague
and
yet
incredibly
inflexible
she
also
submitted

guillory
is
an
interesting
professor;
he
definitely
knows
his
stuff
but
sometimes
lectures
tend
to
be
dense
and
not
conducive
participation
in

puts
a
big
focus
on
historical
context
over
literary
analysis
your
ta

professor
guillory
is
a
nice
person
but
his
lecture
style
too
circuitous
for
my
taste
constant
tangents
get
tiresome
after
while
and
it
difficult
to
take
notes
when
successive
points
don't
match
up
with
each
other
tas
also
grade
very
harshly;
you
need
be
stellar
writer
if
want
do
well
good
luck

one
of
the
best
lecturers
you

they're

he's
ace
incredibly
good
lectures
and
always
packed
full
of
information
despite
meandering
bit
hope
get
as
an
advisor
in
the
department
-----
i
wanted
so
badly
to
ask
him
out;
he's
cute
and
awkward
but
intelligent
charming
as
hell
his
lectures
are
freaking
brilliant:
such
original
theses
that
make
each
lecture
an
artful
essay
idiosyncratic
product
of
genius
whether
it
be
the
concept
scopophilia
wandering
or
sexual
ambiguity
interesting;
always
left
satisfied

good
notes
or
doing
something
else
in
order
stay
awake

had
tippit
for
labor
economics
overall
he
is
a
fair
grader
lectures
are
not
mandatory
but
gives
pop
quizzes
once
in
while
that
count
towards
extra
credit
one
bad
thing
about
rather
monotone
it's
kind
of
hard
to
keep
focused

i
think

does
not
curve
the
grades

makes
it
really
tough
to
get
an
a

were
confusing

exam
was
group
take-home
-----
i
liked
the
prof
:
don't
really
remember
what
learned
during
both
lectures
labor
&
public
-
probably
slept
or
surfed
on
internet
but
thought
grades
were
pretty
fair
was
very
easy
public's
exams
hard
and
unclear
overall
think
something
from
class
as
we
had
to
know
stuffs
do
homeworks
-----
had
him
for
labor
and
public
econ
overall
both
classes
were
pretty
good
informative
he
goes
by
the
book
most
part
as
long
you
read
assignments
attend
lectures
should
be
fine
unless
you're
interested
in
subject
matter
you'd
find
these
boring
no
who
teaches
them
-----
awesome
professor
really
cares
about
his
students
and
takes
the
time
to
learn
their
names
though
lectures
are
kind
of
dry
since
he
goes
straight
from
book
it's
unavoidable
definitely
admits
it
tries
make
class
interesting
is
very
helpful
during
office
hours
-----
good
teacher
the
final
exam
was
pretty
hard
but
he
gave
a
lot
of
opportunity
beforehand
to
work
and
rack
up
points
it
you
-----
one
of
the
worst
teachers
in
nyu
tricked
us
all
into
thinking
he
was
using
a
joke
grading
system
and
then
failed
everyone
on
their
final
exam
paper
noone
complained
how
bad
teacher

thought
were
getting
a's
anyway

with
her
students
takes
their
thoughts
seriously
firmly
believes
in

great
professor
to
take
warm
you
up
university
life
i
learned
so
much
in
this
class
she
does
go
on
the
occasional
tangent
but
don't
tune
them
out
because
there
valuable
information
-----
helen
is
literally
one
of
the
greatest
teachers
i've
had
though
she
does
give
a
lot
readings
an
amazing
teacher
very
passionate
and
thorough
about

-----
i
took
helen
as
a
freshman
for
its
in
the
fall
and
she's
possibly
one
of
my
favorite
women
existence
hilarious
made
8am
lively
so
knowledgeable
her
subject
isn't
afraid
to
talk
about
issues
outside
theatre
world
readings
can
be
long
she
will
give
pop
quizzes
but
grading
actually
too
harsh
-----
i
have
helen
shaw
for
my
freshman

class
and
she
is
absolutely
amazing
her
lectures
are
always
so
interesting
jokes

the
super
enjoyable
reading
a
bit
killer
quizzes
can
be
daunting
but
once
you
get
through
that
delight
love
-----
best
professor
ever
-----
massive
time
wasted
on
tortured
jokes
when
considering
the
amount
laid
out
for
nyu
bfa
students

should
be
quality
and
education
above
basic
level
-----
i
was
greatly
disappointed
too
many
self-adoring
jokes
at
the
expense
of
coverage
material
learned
very
little
and
had
to
re-live
high
school
a
kind
desperate
feeling
in
her
routine
low
on
rigor
-----
she
is
a
truly
hilarious
and
wonderful
brilliant
human
being
who
also
happens
to
look
little
like
emma
stone

opened
me

a
wonderful
teacher

gives
lot
of
reading

you
are
taking
its
as
a
freshman

her
first

but
she
actually
made
it

literally
the
funniest
woman
i
have
ever
met
and
we
all
constantly
laughing
in
class
lots
of
work
honestly
it's
fine
fact
that
awesome
makes
not
matter
:
-----
he's
a
curmudgeon
in
the
best
way
so
knowledgeable
and
if
you're
outspoken
bright
he'll
love
you
been
around
block
has
lot
to
teach
my
favorite
professor
thus
far
-----
prof
serrin
is
not
only
a
great
educator
he's
person
-----
not
sure
what
other
rater's
criticism
is
all
abouttook
serrin
for
poverty
politics
and
immigration
capstoneintimidating
only
at
first
a
character
-
hilarious
kind
no
bs
man
who
has
seen
the
world
an
written
about
it
times
mind
you
take
him
one
of
few
i
plan
on
visitingunless
he's
in
montana
:
-----
serrin
is
half
senile
idisrespectful
and
completely
incompetent
if
you
want
to
express
your
opinion
his
answer
is:
i'm
the
professor
don't
argue
with
me
he
doesn't
remember
what
said
last
class
very
often
contradicts
himself
in
an
absurd
way
generally
a
disgrace
nyu
should
have
retired
long
time
ago
-----
the
absolute
best
funny
kind
engaging
take
class
if
you
can
we
had
at
his
apartment
twice
and
went
to
spamalot
he
took
us
out
dinner
in
small
groups
plus
knows
stuff
was
very
interesting
nobody
understands
grading
but
that's
okay
most
definitely
this
-----
prof
serrin
is
the
best
i
turn
to
him
for
advice
constantly
his
past
students
have
come
back
talk
class
and
are
all
doing
amazing
things
in
journalism
-----
he
is
so
horrible
disrespecting
other
people's
cultures
always
intimidating
students
and
grade
our
assignment
according
to
his
mood
needs
learn
how
respect
others
before
teaches
in
nyu
btw
i'm
glad
that
will
retire
soon
for
the
sake
of
journalism
department
-----
how
come
a
well-respected
journalist
like
you
could
protect
professors
who
illegitimately
forbade
student
to
write
about
iraq
palestine
israelvietnam
and
withheld
grade
of
an
exclusive
story
conversation
between
vietnamese
henry
kissinger
i'm
extremely
disappointed
don't
hide
pls
all
is
under
the
light
conscience
-----
how
did
craig
wolff
make
you
refuse
to
hear
my
account
about
him
withhelding
grades
illegitimately
force
me
take
his
next
class
what
tell
mary
quigley
protest
against
wolff's
quid
pro
quo
harassment
so
she
created
a
hostile
academic
environment
good
journalist
don't
protect
harasser
and
discriminator
-----
by
far
the
best
teacher
and
class
i
have
ever
taken
serrin
is
a
dream
fun
projects
interesting
subject
material
plus
he
totally
runs
based
on
needs
of
students
top
everything
hilarious
laid
back
do
not
miss
chance
to
as
-----
professor
serrin
is
magical
he
makes
the
materiel
somehow
very
accessible
and
interesting
yet
still
challenging
this
essentially
an
american
history
course
that
counts
as
a
science
man
so
knowledgble
funny
wrote
textbook
knows
what
he's
doing
-----
nobody
should
go
through
the
nyu
journalism
program
without
taking
professor
serrin
he's
best
of
what
they
have
to
offer
period
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
ever
had
at
nyu
serrin
is
so
nice
and
laid-back
he
even
moved
class
to
ben
jerry's
for
free
cone
day
-----
probably
the
best
professor
i
had
at
nyu
took
two
of
his
classes
and
visited
him
in
office
frequently
for
advice
so
kind
helpful
very
accessible
unlike
a
lot
professors
here
-----
the
best
instructor
that
i
have
ever
had
at
any
level
-----
had
her
for
both
hap
and
maternity
she
is
fair
has
high
standards
a
very
good
professor
quite
few
people
have
issues
with
but
i
think
their
disapproval
stems
from
poor
performance
on
exams
in
courses
you
to
read
the
book
do
well
which
stated
multiple
times
grader
quality
-----
professor
jackson
is
clear
about
what
she
expects
from
her
students
but
seemed
to
have
lost
touch
unwilling
listen
ideas
and
change;
complete
brick
wall
hard
approach
it
was
not
an
enjoyable
experience
at
all
-----
prof
nj
does
talk
a
lot
about
he
family
stories
but
they
are
tied
in
with
what
she
is
teaching
if
you
come
to
class
and
pay
attention
take
notes
then
will
learn
always
find
good
pictures
describe
the
topic
talking
so
close
do
fine
-----
one
of
the
best
teachers
i
have
every
had
yes
she
has
high
expectations
and
too
many
nyus'
nursing
students
think
they
pay
tuition
expect
to
be
spoon-fed
told
what
is
on
test
expects
study
always
available
those
who
want
put
in
effort
for
grade
-----
had
nvj
for
maternity
b
&
health
assessment
a-
and
if
you
work
hard
then
get
the
grade
that
deserve
very
generous
with
project
to
help
pass
exams
are
lab
quizzes
straight
out
of
textbook
unapproachable
outside
class
you're
lazy
you'll
definitely
fail
her
-----
jackson
does
not
care
about
students
she
doesnt
tell
you
what
to
study
and
wants
read
the
whole
book
tests
are
hard
very
specific
inclass
its
all
her
family
-----
seems
nice
in
class
but
mean
and
doesn't
care
about
students
if
you
talk
to
her
one-on-one
classes
aren't
helpful
just
telling
stories
she
takes
attendance
reading
the
text
is
a
must
because
that's
all
tests
are
on
good
luck
-----
one
of
the
worst
professors
i've
ever
had
mean
hard
and
doesn't
care
about
anyone
i
don't
know
why
she
hasn't
been
fired
yet
because
no
likes
her
maternity
should
not
have
that
especially
since
lectures
are
based
around
stories
-----
she's
mean
and
very
unfriendly
she
doesnt
smile
or
display
any
motherly
like
qualities
her
tests
for
maternity
are
so
hard
unfair
-----
i've
had
health
assessment
and
maternity
w
professor
jackson
she
is
one
of
the
best
professors
in
nursing
department
humorous
clear
very
passionate
about
what
does
i
love
her
-----
don't
expect
too
many
smiles
from
her
she
is
very
hard
knows
stuff
but
fair
definitely
will
fail
you
if
must
even
are
a
tenth
of
point
passing
class
i
got
through
it
by
putting
in
the
time
and
effort
let
bad
grade
on
exams
scare
there
room
with
lab
grades
papers
assigns
-----
she
is
not
the
nicest
professor
and
likes
to
tell
a
lot
of
stories
about
herself
as
mom
her
own
kids
does
get
pt
during
lecture
time
come
exam
gets
very
specific
good
avoid
classes
if
you
can
-----
no
comments
-----
very
tough
but
fair
almost
overwhelming
amount
of
work
in
her
class
i
wouldn't
suggest
taking
this
with
another
clinical
or
heavy
coursload
-----
no

to
take

with
familiarity
of

but
his

-----
loved
this

a
little
too
much

i
got
it
done
he
very
responsive
when
asked
for
help
the
lectures

were
interesting
explained

great
instructor
-----
he
tries
to
make
the
topic
as
comprehensive
possible
his
lectures
are
important
so
pay
close
attention
i
would
still
read

-----
hands
down
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
ever
encountered
he
is
funny
knows
his
material
and
most
importantly
not
boring
class
type
you
will
dread
going
to
lots
homework
easy
but
time
consuming
doesn't
make
student
buy
expensive
textbook
mine
was
$11
on
amazon
-----
one
thing
i
can
say
is
that
if
you
want
to
learn
how
understand
and
implement
financial
statement
analysis
-
will
with
professor

creditors

most
importantly
takes
good
take
subject

-professor
did
exactly
-----
this
is
a
very
nuts
and
bolts
approach
to
financial
statement
analysis
you
need
do
think
about
this;
can
always
look
up
that
which
makes
it
different
from
classes
require
memorizing
material
will
eventually
be
forgotten
chris
accessible;
it's
clear
he
wants
students

well
-----
chris
is
an
excellent
teacher
with
a
lot
of
real
world
experience
he
was
able
to
connect
the
relevant
concepts
from
textbook
incidents
and
scenarios
that
actually
occurred
for
someone
like
me
starting
out
in
credit
commercial
lending
it
extremely
helpful
have
who
connected
all
dotsthanks
-----
chris
was
excellent
-
simplified
concepts
and
pulled
out
only
relevant
information
repeated
to
ensure
key
were
emphasized
again
so
you
leave
knowing
the
important
things
accessible
added
personal
stories
put
in
a
real-world
context
highly
recommended
would
take
another
class
for
sure
with
him
-----
chris
was
a
teacher
who
managed
to
weed
out
the
relevant
from
not
as
it
pertains
real
working
world
he
very
clear
and
patient
-----
very
easy
and
comfortable
teacher
to
learn
from
he
manages
take
challenging
concepts
use
real
world
examples
make
them
understandable
additionally
made
understanding
the
creation
of
a
cash
flow
statement
exceptionally
unlike
every
accounting
finance
course
i've
previously
experienced
i
highly
recommend
this
professor
-----
has
the
art
of
making
complicated
concepts
appear
simple
also
provides
a
context
around
subject
so
that
common
sense
is
developed
to
complement
practical
analysis
good
choice
book
great
humour
funny
stories
wisdom
tips
based
on
blood
sweat
and
tears
made
even
financial
fun

can't
ask
for
more

-----
great
teacher
-----
no
-----
professor
ronell
delivers
the
most
mind
blowing
performative
lectures
her
readings
of
kafka
nietzsche
derrida
deleuze
heidegger
freud
and
others
opened
up
a
new
world
for
me
she
is
kind
honorable
funny
caring
i
highly
recommend
classes
-----
if
you
like
comparative
lit
you'll
love
avital
she's
inspiring
but
she
tends
to
talk
in
circles
and
goes
off
on
tangents
a
lot
doesn't
allow
computers
her
lectures
though
so
be
warned
-----
she
is
not
your
usual
type
of
professor
that's
for
sure
literally
performs
her
classes:
every
word
that
comes
from
mouth
pure
poetry
philosophy
everyone's
cup
tea
but
i
loved
-----
often
misunderstood:
in
class
she
is
not
only
teaching
the
subject
but
also
a
very
singular
conception
of
professor
and
philosophy
through
self-conceived
postmodern
performatic
method
that
makes
use
facial
gesture
body
language
vocal
expression
plus
sartorial
make-up
props:
truly
revolutionary

-----
so
great
i
loved
watching
her
train
of
thought
and
went
out
my
way
to
take
another
class
with
this
semester
youtube
if
you
really
want
know
she's
on
there
-----
shes
great
smart
funny
and
very
challenging
-----
just
plain
awesome
but
never
-----
she
is
one
of
the
most
important
scholar
thinker
alive
today
it
an
honor
to
learn
from
her
amazing
teacher
and
someone
who
can
teach
you
endlessly
about
yourself
world
-----
i
have
to
agree
with
some
of
the
criticism
here
incredibly
intelligent
seriously
-
very
sharp
but
if
you
want
witness
an
academic
cult
personality
at
its
most
grovelling
take
this
class
and
watch
how
people
who
disagree
professsor
there
must
be
other
poets
than
holderlin
rilke
examine
get
eviscerated
-----
anyone
who
brings
their
brain
to
her
is
lucky
be
alive
and
at
nyu
-----
her
class
was
teh
best
one
i
took
at
nyu
she's
brilliant
and
interesting
not
all
just
rote
versions
of
theory
original
helpful
take
-----
sad
case
she's
hopelessly
stuck
in
the
effete
pseudo-philosophical
theory
camp
of
decades
ago
can't
think
outside
rote
memorization
derrida
and
heidegger
ridiculously
pretentious
to
boot
study
with
a
serious
*scholar*
instead
-----
she
is
ridiculous
-----
prof
murray
is
a
great
caring
and
very
clear
professor
her
class
on
tv
history
was
super
interesting
the
test
given
are
directly
from

her
lectures
are
really
useful
she
always
posts
them
the
readings
interesting
but
not
necessary
if
you
pay
attention
in
class
participation
will
definitely
give
a
boost
tests
very
straight
forward
and
aren't
difficult
syllabus
is
clear
on
how
what
grading
-----
prof
murray
is
very
knowledgable
and
her
lectures
are
really
interesting
heavier
on
readings
but
as
long
you
read
them
before
the
tests
you'll
be
fine
fair
grading
-----
knowledgeable
professor
the
material
lends
itself
to
dryness
because
much
of
it
is
a
repeat
studied
in
several
other
mcc
classes
not
demanding
course
if
you
stay
on
top
materials
and
screenings
i
enjoyed
class
her
structuring
dry
wit
-----
i
took
television
history
and
form
with
professor
murray
this
semester
she
is
a
good
very
clear
bit
boring
at
times
but
overall
class
grading
done
in
straight
forward
manner
if
you
go
to
do
most
of
the
readings
screenings
will
get
grade
-----
she
is
a
very
fair
grader
and
all
assignments
are
also
nice
helpful
it
was
her
first
time
teaching
amateur
media
knew
lot
but
often
knowledge
around
photography
the
class
kind
of
boring
articles
lectures
were
common
sense
or
dull
more
history
based
then
i
thought
-----
one
of
the
best
classes
profs
i've
had
at
nyu
-----
i
thought
this
would
be
an
fun
class
but
she's
quite
a
hard
ass
tons
of
reading
the
focus
more
on
cultural
impact
it's
all
technical
and
about
rules
regulations
tv
kind
hate
-----
great
teacher
it's
a
fun
subject
and
she
is
organized
clear
about
what
requires
the
midterm
final
are
extremely
straightforward
just
do
readings
at
some
point
research
paper
work
but
fact
matter
interesting
so
it
goes
by
fast
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
professor
class
-----
she's
very
nice
and
she
knows
what
talking
about
make
sure
to
take
good
notes
bc
the
tests
rele
come
from
paying
attention
says
in
class
a
lot
of
rdgs
pretty
lecture
based
but
with
fun
enjoyable
tv
clips
cool
-----
awesome
very
knowledgeable
has
a
clear
plan
of
where
she
wants
to
go
with
the
class
concentrates
lot
on
radio
in
beginning
so
expect
historical
readings
good
about
answering
questions
and
clarifying
when
you
are
confused
highly
recommended

what
everyone
else
said
-----
this
guy
is
undoubtedly
the
worst
professor
in
world
i
cannot
believe
he
has
a
phd
let
alone
head
of
department
explain
even
basic
concepts
correctly
because
doesn't
know
them
it's
unbelievable
how
little
knows
about
basics
his
own
course
rambles
on
off
topic
for
simples
questions
unreal
-----
nothing
much
to
say
just
avoid
him
the
worst
professor
in
my
entire
life
no
question
-----
i
like
him
he
is
kind
of
funny
but
his
classes
are
terrible
the
whole
music
tech
program
a
messdont
enroll
in
this
-----
nyu
music
technology
is
led
by
him
and
it
chaotic
nowsomeone
needs
to
organize
-----
so
he
makes
you
choose
your
grade
at
the
end
of
term
even
if
do
all
work
participate
in
class
and
show
true
effort
obtaining
knowledge
subject
digital
audio
processing
still
only
get
a
b
while
kids
who
not
any
up
on
rare
occasions
also
fair
-----
i
think
it
would
be
safer
to
rate
the
professor
after
you
have
completed
one
or
two
courses
with
him
guy
knows
little
about
subject
while
it's
great
that
he
leaves
us
learn
on
our
own
should
also
there
when
we
questions
and
able
answer
them
correctly
not
mention
-----
he
takes
a
broad
educational
approach
in
his
teaching
which
is
exactly
what
department
head
should
do
also
has
some
people
skills
-
quality
often
lacking
the
music
tech
environs
-----
ugh
i
have
him
for
dap
and
ii
until
he
retires
good
luck
the
man
should
not
be
teaching
-----
no
comments
-----
i
took
two
courses
with
him
during
my
tenure
at
nyu:
electronic
music
syth
and
advanced
computer
composition
if
you
like
an
academic
approach
mean
that
in
the
truest
sense
to
technology
than
will
probably
enjoy
his
classes
he
puts
a
box
forces
think
about
other
compositional
factors
enjoyed
but
they
aren't
for
everyone
-----
dresses
and
acts
like
a
bad
used
car
salesman
nice
guy

head
of
my
department
saw
him
once
in
4
years
get
bishai
dubois
as
heads
you'll
have
real
deparment
-----
biggest
waste
of
$6k
in
my
life
-----
i'm
still
reeling
-----
at
first
a
bit
intimidating
because
he
does
expect
his
students
to
be
comfortable
with
all
prior
courses
however
create
extra
classes
where
you
can
ask
him
any
question
have
regarding
material
covered
or
personal
curiosity
they
are
very
helpful
grades
on

40%

european
scottish
professor

are
given
style
40%
is
a
passing
score
curve
huge
explanations
very
clear
office
hours
helpful
he
uses
them
almost
as
an
extra
lecture
great
for
seeing
examples
worked
out
-----
take
him
if
you
can
he
is
extremely
helpful
and
a
phenomenal
teacher
always
has
good
explanations
for
everything
to
rush
somedays
more
than
willing
explain
in
depth
either
via
email
of
after
class
-----
the
best
professor
i
have
ever
had
he
is
very
clear
with
his
explanations
and
just
brilliant
you
to
be
willing
work
hard
but
genuinely
cares
about
students
always
help
go
office
hours
actually
made
me
love
maths
-----
great
professor
very
helpful
-----
one
of
my
favorite
professors
clear
lectures
with
a
lot
examples
that
were
consistent
his
tests
showed
interest
in
students
weekly
homework
but
not
too
much
quizzes
recitation
midterms
quite
long
uploads
lecture
notes
-----
he
comes
from
a
rigorous
education
system
so
expects
you
to
put
the
work
in
studying
midterm
i
was
insanely
tough
but
looking
back
over
it
very
fair
curving
office
hours
attendance
are
must
if
do
not
understand
material
end
class
curve
generous
really
makes
for
grade
you'll
thank
him
-----
he
hardly
ever
replies
to
emails
which
is
a
little
rude
and
frustrating
however
that
aside
his
lectures
were
great
extremely
helpful
tests
are
challenging
but
if
you
did
the
work
they
weren't
terribly
difficult
prepared
us
well
for
final
i
honestly
thought
hated
math
until
this
class
really
wonderful
instructor
overall
-----
his
tests
were
ridiculously
hard
but
he
reassures
students
that
although
a
grade
may
seem
bad
to
them
it
really
isn't
and
helps
you
get
through
those
rough
times
plus
accent
hotness
the
long
lectures
just
listen
scottish
you'll
be
dazed
-----
nice
person
-----
okay
yes
he
expects
a
lot
of
prior
knowledge
but
he's
new
to
nyu
and
got
high
standards
very
approachable
definitely
cares
about
his
students
especially
if
you
put
the
effort
in
uploads
all
lecture
notes
is
depthspecific
with
topics
exams
are
difficult
i'm
sure
those
will
change
over
time
-----
he's
a
seriously
brilliant
guy
the
material
is
hard
and
lot
has
to
be
covered
quickly
but
he'll
help
you
if
take
time
ask
-----
has
high
standards
of
knowledge
on
mathematics
compared
to
other
professors
bc
he
is
originally
from
europe
expects
a
lot
detail
laughs
at
you
when
don't
understand
things
considers
be
basic
hard
reach;
doesn't
respond
emails
shares
his
lecture
notes
online
tests
and
hw
are
10x
harder
than
what
goes
over
in
class

although
his
lectures
are
very
pointless
and
exams
hard
44
midterm
average

he's
hot
that

-----
lectures
are
not
useful
at
all
make
you
doing
the
same
thing
repeating
on
boring
do
follow
syllabus
schedule
have
no
clear
rubric
wont
take
his
class
again
-----
the
class
is
very
easy
we
watch
a
ton
of
movies
and
tests
are
open
note
with
questions
given
in
advance
definitely
good
to
take
if
you
trying
fulfill
map
requirement
so
happy
i
chose
this
one
-----
he
is
so
nice
funny
with
the
board
and
just
laughs
when
class
at
him
shows
a
lot
of
movies
--
good
way
to
learn
about
another
culture

-----
i
don't
know
why
this
guy
has
such
a
bad
reputation
the
class
is
easy
subject
matter
fairly
interesting
he
isn't
most
person
to
have
ever
lectured
but
makes
everything
understand
it's
always
funny
trying
teach
him
how
use
smart
board
overall
may
not
be
excitingbut
he's
great
professor

arvind

class
itself
quite
easy
blame

defenetly
recommend
him
for

boring
it
really
was
bad
at
all

the
class
is
generally
easy
25%
of
it

you
gotta
read
book
articles
and
post
summarys
or
your
thoughts
them
if
remember
that
you'll
do
fine
midterm
final

i've
heard

he
cares

however
so
the

at

bearable
material
little

i
found

to
be
interesting

very
frustrating

the
volume

we
were
responsible
for
was
overwhelming
and
while
did
well
in

it
a
stressful
experience

lecture
portion
she
was
pretty
good
showed
us
some
great
clips
and
even
a
full
movie
made
laugh
sometimes
too
however
her
lectures
tended
to
drag
on
of
the
topics
went
right
over
head
-----
she's
a
great
person
and
i
think
she
is
professor
although
people
may
take
her
for
granted

i
took
her
anatomy
of
difference
for
upper
level
undergrads
and
grad
students

it
was
excellent
brilliant

nice
teacher;
poor
lecturer
needs
to
give
more

what
was
already

in
the
textbook

she
was
pretty
awesome
a
bit
boring
but
all
around
cool
teacher
-----
she's
so
into

liked
talking
about
riefenstahl
and
dw
griffiths
then
said

helpful
and
facilitates

well
tell
her
if
you
want
more
discussion
don't
buy
every

just
need

it's
bogus
the
thing
that
this
requires

no
easy
cas
course
will
read

a
stronger
writer
for
it
-----
pat
is
fantastic
and
easily
one
of
the
best
teachers
i've
had
at
gallatin
i
thought
that
monsters
in
popular
culture
merely
looked
like
a
fun
class
to
take
over
summer
but
ended
up
learning
ton
information
theory
that's
been
instrumental
my
concentration

patty
is
a
wonderful
woman
who
has
opened
my
eyes

this

is
fluffy
easy
fun
vampires
zombies
what's
not
to
like
right
unless
you
want
learn
something
twilight
movie
reviews
can't
teach
my
problem
with
prof
that
she
puts
on
airs
speaks
a
contrived
accent
and
condescending
students
although
in
way
seems
nice
very
into
herself
-----
i
just
finished
monsters
in
popular
culture
with
prof
lennoxand
loved
it
she
is
probably
my
favorite
gallatin
professor
so
far
love
that
also
open
to
giving
extra
time
for
papers
if
you
need
it;
wrote
one
of
best
thought
because
had
a
few
days
very
interesting
material
but
difficult
get
an
-----
good
selection
of
readings
and
flexible
with
paper
topics
however
she
is
unclear
about
assignment
overall
course
expectations
generally
unprepared
for
class

i
took
her
monster's
in
popular
culture
class
as
well
shakespeare
course
she
is
one
of
the
best
teachers
gallatin
and
if
you
are
ready
to
work
will
exit
a
better

pat
lennox
is
the
best
professor
i've
had
at

i
her
for
myths
and
fables
she
was
excellent

so
interesting
our
discussions
were
always
relevant
intellectually
stimulating
has
also
been
extremely
helpful
to
me
networking
purposes
am
very
greatful
it
would
definitely
recommend
m&f
-----
the
worst
professor
i
have
ever
had
not
learned
anything
about
subject
nor
writing
and
class
is
a
seminar
discussions
rarely
get
interesting
because
she
does
know
how
to
facilitate
them
seems
unprepared
for
even
wastes
time
talking
irrelevant
topics
fill
said

pretty
much
no

very
flexible
with

class
is
all
discussion
and
she
loves
hearing
everyone's
opinions
open
to
topics
definitely
take
her
-----
amazing
this
is
one
of
the
best
classes
i've
ever
taken
i
believe
that
while
she
does
stray
on
tangents
they
are
all
for
reasons
you
can
use
any
those
'pointless'
in
your
paper
and
will
be
very
impressed
knows
exactly
what
saying
when
says
it
no
time
wasted
love
class
recom
-----
she's
sweet
but
wastes
way
too
much
time
talking
about
pointless
things
get
back
on
track
the
material
is
pretty
cool
though
and
what
you
write
very
open
-----
he
is
a
wonderful
smart
witty
and
good
old
fashioned
english
professor
who
truly
cares
about
the
text
s
student's
engagement
with
it
he's
very
business-oriented
but
will
stretch
you
wonderfully
no
easy
as
can
earn
them
hard
work
i
be
taking
him
again
in
fall
-----
you
must
take
one
class
with
him
before
graduate
from
nyu
if
not
would
have
wasted
your
education
here
he
is
very
organized
knowledgeable
humble
and
helpful
highly
recommended
for
those
who
really
want
to
push
themselves
but
people
seeking
easy
a's
a
particular
semester
because
work
hard
-----
archer

a
great
professor
very
helpful
his
lectures
are
long
but
funny
and
interesting
the
readings
for
most
part
aren't
too
bad
i
learned
lot
only
had
2
papers
during
class
of
them
were
short
detailed
prompts
he
gave
feedback
both
definitely
would
take
again
-----
archer
seems
like
a
good
person
even
very
no
doubt
he's
sweetheart
that
said
he
has
filter
whatsoever
and
can
be
one
hell
of
sharp-tongued
sob
patience
for
stupidity
does
not
hold
back
anything
some
the
stuff
comes
out
his
mouth
makes
me
think
wow
people
say
i'm
harsh
blunt
rude

the

and
very
witty
times
i
recommend

-----
word
of
warning
this
guy
doesn't
suffer
fools
gladly
if
you
say
something
weird
or
awkward
in
class
he
might
be
pretty
cruel

i
learned

he
was
always
well-prepared
interesting
-----
professor
archer
gives
interesting
lectures
and
is
clearly
passionate
about
the
subject
matter
he
often
runs
into
things
because
he's
excited
something
not
looking
where
going
i
enjoy
hearing
his
perspectives
on
various
aspects
of
shakespeare
plus
ta
had
for
this
course
sarah
ostendorf
was
awesome
very
helpful
-----
john
archer
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
english
professors
at
nyu
particularly
great
for
those
who
love
shakespeare
renaissance
chaucer
hearing
him
read
in
middle
a
joy
otherwise
his
classes
are
always
very
informative
i've
had
twice
and
my
friend
has
taken
least
4
or
5
times
detailed
criticism
&
genuinely
helpful
-----
archer
is
a
very
smart
professor
who
knows
his
stuff
however
the
grading
was
terrible
because
of
ta
grades
100%
course
everyone
got
c-
to
b+
on
final
and
class
wasn't
even
curved
don't
take
this
unless
you're
willing
sacrifice
for
an
interesting
topic
-----
fair
grading
exams
are
straightforward
passage
identification
with
one
or
two
tricky
excerpts
sparse
work
and
reading:
roughly
play
per
week
papers
each
lectures
interesting
if
you
do
the
reading
-----
professor
archer
is
very
dry
dense
and
really
boring
only
shakespeare
fanatics
find
him
fun
take
if
you
love
otherwise
do
not
-----
professor
archer
is
genuinely
excited
by
shakespeare
he
always
seems
very
happy
to
be
teaching
yet
you
can
get
lost
when
starts
analyzing
the
different
plays
nice
and
intelligent
thing
that
will
make
or
break
your
grade
ta
have
-----
i
think
she
gives
great
feedback
and
the
class
will
help
your
writing
is
lovely
however
way
too
tough
when
it
comes
to
her
grading
would
spend
days
on
my
essay
go
center
various
times
still
never
got
higher
than
a
b+
do
not
fair
with
was
very
stressed
all
semester
-----
professor
souffrant
managed
to
make
a
class
that
i
thought
would
dread
as
first
year
freshman
into
one
of
the
most
valuable
and
interesting
at
times
classes
took
explains
tasks
assignments
clearly
her
can
be
challengingbut
she
is
willing
explain
any
questions
or
concerns
100%
recommend
-----
wte
is
just
one
of
those
annoying
classes
no
matter
the
professor
but
i
do
recommend
souffrant
if
you
participate
and
show
up
to
class
you'll
be
fine
it's
mostly
time
for
brainstorming
content;
so
are
not
confident
in
your
writing
technique
would
seeing
her
office
hours
or
going
center
-----
she
is
very
nice
and
helpful
during
class
make
sure
to
do
your
homework
the
assignments
are
a
lot
easier
spreads
work
out
over
long
period
of
time
-----
i've
never
thought
harder
about
the
color
blue
took
her
class
2
years
ago
and
am
still
so
grateful
for
all
i
learned
in
wte
really
easy
to
talk
during
essay
meetings
-----
im
about
to
graduate
nyu
and
none
of
the
classes
ive
taken
since
wte
with
souffrant
have
topped
her
class
if
you
do
work
ask
for
feedback
she
will
help
greatly
be
attentive
really
hear
-----
professor
souffrant
is
a
wonderful
teacher
who
very
accessible
within
and
outside
of
the
classroom
she
can
definitely
be
described
as
tough
grader
but
if
you
use
concepts
outlines
in
class
should
do
well
always
willing
to
go
over
past
work
expects
all
assignments
completed
so
prepared
for
lot
reading
-----
professor
souffrant
really
helped
me
to
strengthen
my
skills
as
a
writer
i
initially
struggled
with
the
course
but
after
meeting
her
improved
immensely
she
highly
encourages
unique
ideas
and
explorations
in
papers
is
very
challenging
incredibly
rewarding
if
you
utilize
both
writing
center
meetings
-----
very
tough
grader
good
teacher
but
somewhat
unclear
i
did
learn
a
lot
in
her
class
and
help
was
there
when
needed
it
-----
she
cares
about
her
students
and
will
offer
help
if
you
ask
for
it
clarity
is
iffy
but
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
writing
the
essay
thing
in
general
meeting
with
more
than
recommended
time
crucial
let
know
what
you're
trying
to
achieve
don't
understand
give
very
tough
grader
though
-----
she
made
the
class
surprisingly
enjoyable
i
feel
like
learned
a
lot
about
writing
especially
from
that
had
to
take
some
of
assignments
were
pretty
interesting
and
classes
different
shes
nice
seemed
really
care
helping
me
with
my
recommend
this
teacher
-----
in
the
entire
semester
i
have
never
once
clearly
understood
what
she
actually
meant
when
spoke
always
gives
a
vague
idea
without
explaining
it
and
points
out
exactly
agrees
or
disagrees
with
student's
response
don't
think
improved
anything
to
make
matters
worse
my
writings

helpful
if

prof
callihan
is
definitely
a
nice
lady
but
if
you've
struggled
with
english
and
writing
in
high
school
i
don't
think
her
class
would
be
the
best
for

of

very
difficult

so
bit
overwhelming

unenjoyable

in

out

do
well
and
tries
her
best

on
the
right
track
brings
cupcakes

terrible
teacher
she
thinks
is
the
best
thing

talks
down
to
you
if
are
taking
her
class
anywhere
besides
at
princeton

extremely
dismissive
narcissistic
critical
the
material
itself
is
very
interesting
but
don't
plan
on
getting
an
a
-----
you
have
to
work
hard
in
her
class
and
be
willing
take
constructive
criticism
she
doesn't
spoon-feed
which
really
is
a
plus
because
it
motivates
analyze

the
foundational
theories
of

-----
stacey
could
not
have
done
a
better
job
at
teaching
this
material
true
she's
bit
funky
-
but
that's
irrelevant
to
her
and
furthermore
i
liked
it
organized
smart
clear
fair
personally
looked
forward
seeing
each
wardrobe
she
chose
for
the
day
found
be
relatable
made
class
interesting
-----
tends
to
be
dismissive
uninterested
toward
legitimate
responses
from
students
both
in
classroom
discussion
and
graded
items
exams
essays
--
interpreting
student
opinions
an
unnecessarily
negative
light
or
simply
flagging
them
as
irrelevant
extremely
high
estimate
of
own
opinion
unapproachable
unless
one
defers
entirely
her
authority
-----
i
like
her
very
much
extremely
logical
structured
and
smart
good
at
explaining
complex
concepts
is
clearly
well-read
knowledgeable
in
field
beyond
forthcoming
but
not
intimidating-i
am
sick
of
professors
who
try
to
be
nice
nodding
delightfully
silly
comments
class
has
a
quirky
personality
which
great
too
-----
the
lutz
should
be
avoided
at
all
costs
she
comes
off
kind
of
snobby
and
once
every
class
session
will
stomp
out
into
hall
yell
someone
for
being
too
noisy
loves
her
own
voice
often
times
discount
students'
opinions
without
giving
a
good
explanation
as
to
why
they
are
wrong
sometimes
when
student
is
officially
correct
-----
i
took
her
psychology
of
social
behavior
for
the
general
ma
program
she
was
unapproachable
unkind
and
only
applauded
sound
own
voice
in
classroom
suggest
that
you
take
anyone
else
professor
lutz
aspire
to
impart
knowledge
your
students
not
just
engage
us
two
hours
self-love
-----
tedious
professor
who
created
the
literally
most
deadening
environment
in
class
i
have
ever
experienced
very
unhelpful
too
and
narcissistic
to
finally
finish
this
felt
like
being
released
from
prison
-----
bad
teacher
and
stultifying
environment
don't
take
this
course
-----
avoid
this
class
-
tedious
teacher
and
unhelpful
especially
with
grades
-----
i
had
prof
lutz
for
developmental
and
social
psychology
courses
a
great
teacher
-
thorough
pleasant
intelligent
able
to
present
complex
information
very
concisely
an
absolute
joy
go
class
assignments
were
two
papers
three
tests
-----
took
intro
to
digital
media
last
semester
class
was
very
interesting
he
did
a
good
job
in
presenting
different
viewpoints
and
keeping
me
interested
throughout
the
blog
also
useful
-----
this
was
the
worst
class
i
have
ever
taken
completely
based
on
presentations
which
get
old
and
everyone
played
their
laptops
entire
time
concepts
are
hard
but
even
so
a
complete
waste
of
-----
he
is
a
really
great
guy
and
i
didnts
mind
attending
class
but
be
aware
that
it
all
take
home
essay
tests
hard
grader
expects
abstract
connections
not
simply
given
to
you
in
-----
hey
this
was
a
good
class
maybe
not
the
easiest
but
i
learned
lot
from
it
take
him
you
won't
regret
-----
i
took
intro
to
human
comm
and
culture
with
marco
the
readings
he
assigned
way
taught
class
graded
my
friend
recommended
this
course
saying
she
loved
it
was
one
of
her
easiest
grades
very
hard
which
is
unfair
because
doesnt
even
teach
abstract
material
well
at
all
his
curriculum
obscure
-----
marco
is
a
young
and
brilliant
professor
the
readings
he
assigns
are
bit
hard
but
then
spends
time
in
class
trying
to
make
them
accessible
overall
this
was
interesting
i
learned
lot
from
it
-----
ta
for
siva's
last
semester
at
nyu;
class
was
great
if
you
did
the
readings
posted
on
blackboard
no
books
to
buy
marco's
a
little
difficult
understand
and
his
ppt
notes
are
not
sufficient
answer
final
exam
questions
slow
with
returning
grades
-----
highly
recommend
him
-----
marco
is
very
attractive
and
italian
take
his
class
as
there
aren't
many
distinguishing
factors
other
than
these
-----
no
comments
-----
marco
was
a
great
teacher
prepared
helpful
sometimes
even
funny
i
recommend
him
to
anybody
-----
once
you
get
past
the
way
he
pronnounces
things
is
a
great
ta
and
not
too
bad
to
look
at
either
-----
is
she
a
rep
for
the
cdc
that's
all
seems
to
reference
i
guess
point
of
nursing
school
memorize
recommendations
and
not
think
yourself
-
since
after
everything
requires
specialist
cdc's
transparent
reliable
studies
-----
perfect
combination
of
gravitas
wit
and
charm
-----
totally
agree
with
the
previous
comment
she
does
not
prep
you
at
all
for
her
exam
-----
mccabe
knows
her
stuff;
that
being
said
she
does
not
teach
for
the
exam
at
all
is
perhaps
most
vague
professor
i've
had
and
expects
you
to
figure
certain
things
out
she'll
give
interventions
a
disease
will
rank
importance
on
test
are
listed
better
know
which
one
comes
first
-----
if
you
do
the
reading
come
to
class
take
good
notes
and
review
podcasts
as
needed
will
be
fine
dr
mccabe
is
perfect
combination
of
engaging
compassionate
tough
direct
she
really
does
care
about
students
material
teaching
that's
what
helped
me
prepared
-----
i
love
dr
mccabe
she
can
come
off
as
kind
of
blunt
in
class
but
if
you
meet
with
her
individually
she's
amazingly
compassionate
understanding
helpful
etc
was
also
a
really
good
lecturer
-----
not
bad
podcasts
everything
info
needed
for
tests
is
mainly
in
the
powerpoints
-----
made
the
class
tolerable:
mauro
alone
would
have
been
a
nightmare
-----
dr
mccabe
is
the
best
professor
i've
had
in
nyucn
she
has
a
lot
of
experience
especially
geriatric
nursing
to
share
and
keeps
material
engaging
very
helpful
encouraging
clear
i
wish
her
as
clinical
instructor
too
heard
nothing
but
great
things
about
that
position
needless
say
highly
recommended
-----
she
was
awesome
expects
you
do
to
your
work
but
test
come
from
her
notes
and
the
book
best
professor
i
had
at
nyu
-----
organized
clear
and
approachable
the
content
is
basis
of
exams
textbook
reading
a
must
but
professor
mccabe
does
her
best
to
make
it
interesting
-----
i
think
she's
an
awesome
professor
very
helpful
and
really
knows
her
stuff
would
recommend
to
anyone
-----
great
lecturer
accessible
outside
of
teaching
hours
gives
good
feedback
to
assignments
-----
took
his
linear
algebra
this
semester
it's
first
time
teaching
the
subject
so
class
is
pretty
boring
and
also
last
here
in
nyu
cuz
he's
said
to
go
back
australia
next
year
given
that
he
behaves
very
irresponsible
canceled
several
times
sometimes
don't
reply
email
or
just
not
helpful
at
all
-----
he
teaches
using
examples
of
what
not
to
do
is
clear
at
all
i
didnt
attend
lecturs
after
the
first
2
weeks
becuase
knew
id
be
better
off
learning
it
on
my
own
-----
focused
more
on
what
we
shouldnt
do
rather
than
to
he
taught
through
proofs
spent
the
last
review
session
teaching
us
things
didnt
need
know
instead
of
helping
for
final
i
emailed
him
multiple
times
during
semester
and
only
got
a
reply
once
never
fully
answers
questions
not
even
easy
ones
-----
if
he
would
focus
his
efforts
on
trying
to
teach
better
instead
of
be
humorous
a
great
professor
teaches
concepts
through
proofs
but
rarely
gives
helpful
example
problems
those
who
do
well
seemed
so
prior
knowledge
calculus
not
due
what
was
taught
-----
he's
likable
but
he
doesn't
teach
well
most
of
the
time
seems
pretty
confused
himself
and
takes
all
these
times
on
proofs
that
you
don't
really
need
to
know
also
respond
emails
is
funny
or
tries
from
what
i've
heard
about
other
calc1
professors
at
school
better
than
-----
his
accent
complimented
with
incomprehensible
proofs
that
lead
in
circles
right
back
to
confusion
create
an
atmosphere
comparable
hell
itself
man
is
the
devil
he
just
hides

the

when
students
have
questions
he
typically
does
not
answer
in
a
way
that
helps
understand
the
material
has
notes
on
sheet
just
copies
to

as
quickly
possible

will
sit
in
a
diner
with
him
to
chat
for
one-on-one

seems
strange
but
actually
eyeopening
he
genuinely
cares
about
his
students

their
interests

readings
are
unrealistic

bill
is
endearing
and
very
enthusiastic
about
what
he
teaches
i've
found
though
that
seems
to
be
one
of
those
professors
who
feels
their
academic
opinions
interpretations
are
fact
so
if
you
disagree
with
him
it
might
cause
some
tension

intelligent
knowledgeable
respect
every
opinion
sometimes
i
wish
could
be
as
cool
and
amazing
although
a
tough
grader
but
you
can
definitely
learn
lot
in
her
class

pearl
was
my
favorite
part
of
paris
she
taught
me
so
much
tells
funny
stories
and
is
great
at
explaining
difficult
theory

is
one
of
the
greatest
teachers
i've
had
so
far
she
keeps
it
very
real
and
always
down
to
talk
about
social
issues
pushes
you
hard
but
mostly
because
wants

better
i
would
take
her
class
again
even
though
it's
challenging
lots
reading
writing
slack
off

professor
pearl
is
one
of
my
favorite
nyu
professors
so
far
she's
interesting
funny
and
always
gives
everyone
a
chance
to
express
their
opinion
the
reading
she
assigns
really
makes
you
think

was
expecting
typical
writing
class
but
it
much
more
than
that;
learn
lot
about
society
philosophy
culture

this
professor
seriously
changed
my
view
on
writing
and
academics
as
a
whole
i
was
barely
into
the
first
semester
could
already
tell
how
much
better
it's
not
an
easy
class;
you
definitely
have
to
work
for
your
grade
however
if
put
in
you'll
get
amazing
results
taught
me
so
about
our
world

take
professor
pearl
if
you
want
to
become
a
better
writer
and
have
your
perception
of
the
world
changed
forever
she
gives
lot
texts
read
some
which
are
very
dense
but
her
lectures
worth
it

can
be
somewhat
intimidating
is
hilarious
helpful
work
hard
for
an
it's
-----
still
to
this
day
the
best
professor
i've
had
she
chooses
mind-bending
texts
that
challenge
and
shift
your
perception
of
world
you
walk
out
class
knowing
learned
something
i
discovered
a
passion
for
semiotics
gender
studies
which
was
unaware
prior
taking
write
on
these
topics
in
my
classes
now
-----
professor
pearl
is
an
incredibly
smart
and
passionate
about
what
she
teaches
wrote
her
dissertation
on
the
texts
we
read
in
class

prepared
to
work
outside
of
but
i
enjoyed
every
session
due
hilarious
personality
willingness
go
into
as
much
depth
you
need
really
interesting
course
material
well
-----
uses
a
great
list
of
essays
that
challenges
students
to
deconstruct
social
constructions
and
develop
writing
habits
kind
quiet
she
is
helpful
editor
tells
hilarious
stories
but
for
both
you
need
ask
the
professor
respects
her
students'
intelligence
ability
so
will
also
assume
your
understanding
if
don't
demand
help
-----
kind
and
compassionate
professor
tough
grader
pearl
integrates
compelling
philosophical
content
into
her
assignments
this
is
a
writing
class
where
you
might
actually
learn
something
i
highly
recommend
it
-----
very
theoretical
even
though
this
is
a
writing
class
we
used
philosophical
and
texts
in
your
essays
some
topics
covered
year
were
race
gender
forgiveness
cosmopolitanism
funny
willing
to
help
i
would
recommend
her
anyone
looking
for
bit
of
challenge
-----
i
had
her
mideast
class
in
summer
2009
it
was
great
for
a
3
hour
she
really
kept
us
interested
and
examples
were
always
lot
of
work
but
well
worth
wish
they
offer
more
classes
like
hers
during
the
year
-----
she
was
extremely
smart
prepared
when
i
had
her
for
a
middle
eastern
course
in
the
spring
of
2002
felt
lucky
to
have
time
so
topical
it
must
be
noted
that
without
question
hottest
professor
at
college
-----
friendly
professor
good
grasp
of
the
issues
read
textbook
and
she'll
tell
you
what
she's
looking
for
in
writing
-----
had
her
at
fordham
she
was
an
excellent
professor
with
a
combination
of
material
mastery
and
great
ability
to
convey
it
in
understandable
manner
also
extremely
hot
-----
the
lectures
were
fast
and
class
was
challenging
but
worthwhile
-----
top
notch
prof
marji
is
an
engaging
lecturer
and
she
has
the
best
smile
of
any
professor
i've
ever
had
i
loved
class
-----
if
you're
interested
about
gaining
valuable
insight
into
the
middle
east
then
this
is
a
great
class
lots
of
reading
but
exam
questions
were
so
open
ended
that
you
could
really
write
one
or
two
books
and
leave
it
at
on
less
serious
note
she's
quite
attractive
-----
not
only
is
she
a
professor
but
she's
an
underegrad
advisor
too
-----
no
comments
-----
one
of
the
best
teachers
i
had
all
four
years
ask
her
for
help
with
anything
and
she
is
there
you
just
need
to
be
willing
learn
-----
not
great
-----
the
course
material
is
interesting
but
this
class
very
challenging
you
need
to
attend
every
lecture
and
take
good
notes
or
record
do
well
prof
davachi
lectures
fast
so
pay
attention
textbook
useless
there
are
three
exams
only
best
two
counts
also
a
final
literature
critique
-----
lila
is
extremely
condescending
in
class
the
boring
first
half
of
semester
because
though
it
an
advanced
psych
we
go
over
basic
neuro
bio
there
a
20
point
essay
on
exams
that
comes
from
articles
read
recitations
which
she
kindly
failed
to
mention
recitation
mandatory
but
pointless
-----
davachi
was
extremely
clear
in
her
lectures
as
well
interesting
i
never
missed
a
lecture
because
enjoyed
them
so
much
but
the
class
is
hard;
you
have
to
study
textbook
good
reference
useless
otherwise
ta
told
me
that
they
don't
write
own
multichoice
mc
are
really
difficult
on
exams
not
impossible
get
an
-----
first
of
all
don't
buy
the
text
book
okay
this
is
a
rough
class
not
gonna
lie
about
that
one
however
i
started
recording
lectures
which
i've
never
done
my
entire
3
years
at
nyu
and
it
has
proved
very
helpful
you
have
to
find
something
works
for
here
demanding
-----
davachi
is
really
nice
and
clearly
knows
her
information
the
class
ridiculously
difficult
because
ta's
are
terrible
hard
graders
tests
were
super
they're
only
15
mc
worth
6
points
each
an
essay
short
answers
which
easy
but
she
curves
be
prepared
to
study
your
ass
off
-----
she's
great
really
sweet
and
funny
not
an
easy
class
but
put
in
some
effort
you'll
walk
away
from
a
fulfilling
semester
plus
hot
-----
absolutely
hate
her
class
as
a
teacher
she's
not
too
bad
however
lecture
notes
are
so
disorganized
what
she
puts
up
on
blackboard
is
hardly
ever
taught
in
it
makes
following
along
really
difficult
and
come
test
day
you
have
no
idea
which
of
your
corresponds
to
-----
this
class
is
what
made
me
want
to
double
major
in
psychology
she
a
great
teacher
and
the
research
that
has
done
really
impressive
she's
funny
very
clear
during
lectures
which
you
have
attend
order
do
well
yes
pretty
hot
-----
she
makes
it
look
easy
the
ta's
are
good
its
fun
material
but
worth
effort
-----
hot
funny
really
smart
makes
neuroscience
look
easy
and
popular
-----
tests
were
pretty
difficult
the
averages
always
in
60's
good
thing
is
all
curved
only
one
short
paper
davachi
herself
kind
of
unapproachable
but
very
smart
a
lot
test
essays
focused
on
articles
we
had
to
read
for
recitation
which
long
and
hard
-----
enthusiastic
teacher
who
gives
tough
but
fair
exams
go
to
class
and
read
you'll
be
fine
he
prepares
well
for
really
cares
about
the
subject
matter
-----
he
was
a
great
professor
exams
were
exactly
like
practice
and
though
his
examples
might
seem
corny
i
feel
hes
just
trying
to
engage
the
students
would
recommend
him
more
than
skreta
for
sure
-----
very
nice
guy
available
for
questions
or
during
office
hours
he
can
seem
nonchalant
sometimes
especially
with
the
hair
exams
get
hard
but
they're
like
practice
so
if
you
do
those
you'll
well
on
actual
-----
he's
not
great
at
explaining
things
and
he
flips
his
hair
way
too
much
just
reads
off
the
slides
adds
here
there
i'm
sure
other
teachers
are
all
that
good
either
so
-----
i
hate
microeconomics
so
this
class
was
very
difficult
for
me
the
problem
sets
are
just
like
test
questions
and
they
had
a
hard
time
understanding
him
but
it
might
be
that
am
not
good
at
economics
he
is
nice
person
available
office
hours
if
you
take
advantage
of
-----
there's
just
something
about
this
professor
i
don't
like
so
much
maybe
its
the
hair
his
lectures
are
useless
and
recitations
a
complete
waste
of
time
bother
going
to
any
one
good
thing
is
that
he
prints
out
all
lecture
slides
for
you
but
these
unless
go
take
skreta
or
other
-----
his
midterms
and
finals
are
rough
so
study
for
those
but
otherwise
class
isnt
bad
he
cares
a
lot
about
students
-----
sweet
guyvery
awkward
at
times
but
you
learn
to
get
past
it
he
prints
notes
for
and
staples
them
before
class--you
don't
need
do
much;
just
5
problem
sets
a
couple
of
quizzes
the
exams
great
class
sucky
recitationbut
who
cares
-----
not
the
best
professor
ever
but
was
still
able
to
get
material
across
knows
plenty
of
real-world
examples
quizzes
are
easy
and
short
you'll
be
well
prepared
for
exams
much
work
per
night
either
overall
a
nice
class
-----
no
comments
-----
he
is
a
very
nice
professor
and
his
quizzes
are
fairly
easy
as
long
you
briefly
review
slides
pay
attention
to
the
math
problem
examples
before
can
easily
ace
class
doesn't
give
much
mandatory
hw
behavior
be
slightly
nonchalant
leading
boring
classes
at
times
but
overall
earns
my
recommendation
-----
biostats
for
gph
could
be
a
really
engaging
course
but
the
way
roberts
taught
it
made
fall
flat
students
ask
clarifying
questions
in
class
there
was
an
expectation
that
everyone
would
somehow
already
comprehend
every
concept
whether
or
not
they
had
any
quantitative
background
frustrating
semester
most
-----
prof
roberts
expects
everybody
to
be
at
his
level
but
he
lacks
the
point
that
we
are
students
there
learn
it
if
you
so
bothered
with
questions
ask
how
does
learning
happen
then
gets
annoyed
us
asking
get
some
more
clarification
which
doesn't
actually
give
any
take
course
from
someone
else
possib
-----
prof
roberts
seems
to
have
no
respect
for
his
students
even
when
they
try
their
best
improve
performance
he
consistently
rolls
eyes
at
ask
questions
and
goes
out
of
way
make
them
feel
stupid
grades
very
harshly
but
gives
productive
feedback
absolutely
would
not
recommend
-----
worst
professor
and
class
is
100%
of
my
stress
not
only
he
a
harsh
grader
bad
harasses
his
students
through
constant
eye
rolling
but
antagonizing
their
intelligence
on
papers
what
mutters
under
breath
whenever
student
asks
question
unapproachable
save
yourself
please
-----
he
doesn't
care
for
his
students
and
will
not
answer
your
questions
all
of
assignments
tests
are
arbitrary
never
gives
clear
directions
anything
if
you
get
a
point
off
an
assignment
exam
have
no
room
to
improve
lot
attitude
the
is
very
degrading
do
take
him
as
prof
-----
he
doesn't
provide
much
clarifications
for
exams
and
then
is
a
very
tough
grader
often
rushes
through
things
gets
kinda
frustrated
if
you
don't
understand
or
ask
any
additional
questions
not
the
warmest
guy
seem
like
wants
to
be
there
definitely
worst
but
have
opportunity
take
another
prof
consider
it
-----
roberts
provides
you
with
the
minimum
but
in
general
its
very
easy
to
follow
he
likes
things
a
specific
way
so
as
long
your
write
down
exactly
how
it
is
class
you'll
be
ok
does
take
point
off
for

kind
of
annoying
i
found
him
funny

good

-----
roberts
gets
really
irritable
when
you
ask
him
questions
and
isnt
great
at
explaining
things
i
would
take
biostats
with
a
different
professor
if
all
possible
also
large
portion
of
the
grade
is
group
projects
so
get
ready
to
suffer
-----
it
is
pretty
clear
that
prof
roberts
does
not
care
about
his
students
and
he
only
at
nyu
to
do
research
the
bare
minimum
for
won't
give
any
extra
help
special
circumstances
biostatistics
mainly
graded
by
group
project
so
if
you're
given
a
bad
then
you
will
well
in
this
class
-----
fun
professor
you
should
take
him
if
math
isn't
your
thing
-----
if
math
isn't
your
thing
you'll
have
to
work
slightly
harder
otherwise
super
easy
as
long
you
do
the
minimal

out

no
memorization
lots
room
throw
ideas
around
&
explore
-----
song
made
this
course
so
interesting
and
enjoyable
her
essays
require
lots
of
effort
but
i
find
myself
feeling
satisfied
doing
the
work
applying
all
that
i've
learned
you
will
learn
much
from

granted
do
readings
pay
attention
in
lecture
can
honestly
say
is
one
my
favorite
classes
at
nyu
-----
song
is
so
passionate
about
photography:
gives
great
captivating
relevant
lectures
the
work
very
manageable
on
a
weekly
basis
though
she
tough
grader
in
end
encourages
you
to
make
papers
&
arguments
that
are
proud
of
too

she
does
want

stifles
what
everyone
has

that
conducted
already
sometimes
missing
your

ego
i
certainly
wanted

but
was

towards

-----
i
loved
this
professor
the
students
that
complain
about
her
are
most
likely
idiots
just
because
she
wants
to

as
horrible

professor
watts
is
a

he
has
excessive
knowledge
about

super
nice
and
really
easy

he
gives
quizzes
most
lectures
which
means
who
have

but
lets
you
make
them
up
if

shelds

informative
lectures
usually
straight

great
teacher
he's
very
clear
about
what

his

style
is
extremely
clear
and
well
organized
the
homework
assignments
are
interesting
well-explained
-----
i
am
a
computer
science
major
but
this
class
was
hands
down
my
favorite
of
college
so
far
assignments
are
breeze
quizzes
tests
not
quite
easy
enough
mostly
just
loved
coming
to
lecture
which
balances
music
and
history
with
good
humor
highly
recommended
-----
this
course
music
and
politics
was
straight-forward
as
long
you
read
show
up
there
is
alot
of
participation
which
makes
lectures
glide
by
writing
but
i
found
better
than
a
final
exam
although
did
not
do
great
on
the
paper
-----
loved
this
class
fun
enthusiastic
lectures
most
of
the
assignments
were
actually
entertaining
to
do
recommended
-----
if
you
like
to
write
papers
take
this
class
midterm
is
submitting
four
journal
entries
and
final
part
one
the
other
also
have
about
8
response
do
throughout
semester
a
ten-page
research
paper
not
an
extremely
hard
just
get
ready
but
there
manageable
-----
this
class
is
really
fun
and
i
will
miss
it
overall
the
isn't
difficult
at
all
just
involves
a
lot
of
memorization
challenge
time
to
distinguish
different
genres
music
by
ear
copy
down
everything
written
in
blue
on
powerpoint
slides
highly
recommend
definitely
enjoyed
-----
okay
so
if
you
want
to
take
this
class
for
an
easy
a
just
don't
tooo
much
study
dont
expect
be
-----
good
guy
very
tough
final
exam
be
prepared
to
know
specifics
up
the
wazoo
and
i
recommend
going
office
hours
even
though
didn't
overall
interesting
class
won't
say
enjoyable
because
it
really
wasn't
but
worth
take
if
you're
willing
study
100
flashcards
for
ps
he
kicked
a
kid
out
of
being
on
his
phone
-----
the
material
is
super
digestible
professor
awesome
and
very
knowledgeable
however
rock
history
a
bit
of
stretch
it
should
be
pop
if
you
were
hoping
to
cover
specific
band
he
may
skip
over
i
waited
whole
semester
talk
about
rage
against
machine
0
just
take
class
though
don't
that
guy
its
fun:
-----
there
are
a
lot
of
required
readings
but
honestly
i
didn't
read
them
all
and
still
did
decently
well
in
the
course
is
attendance
pop
quizzes
though
so
going
to
class
practically
mandatory
generally
this
was
interesting
he
seemed
really
enjoy
teaching
subject
he's
super
sweet
teacher
isn't
hard
-----
by
far
the
best
course
i
have
ever
taken
prof
tausig
is
very
knowledgeable
in
his
field
as
well
progressive
and
down
to
earth
definitely
recommend
taking
any
with
him
-----
horrible
professor
-
speaks
with
an
accent
that
makes
it
difficult
to
understand
what
he
is
saying
gives
ridiculously
hard
midterms
and
final
2
homework
assignments
due
per
week
webassign
written
hw
-----
although
he's
a
nice
guy
terrible
professor
disregarding
the
accent
he
doesn't
know
how
students'
minds
think
and
consequently
will
make
huge
illogical
leaps
between
steps
during
lecture
leaving
everyone
confused
homeworks
quizzes
are
ridiculously
difficult;
exams
much
easier
-----
always
explain
with
brief
but
clear
proofs
has
his
own
thoughts
other
than
textbooks
-----
a
really
nice
professor
smiles
lot
though
the
exercises
and
tests
are
not
super
easy
it's
hard
you
can
truly
learn
something
in
lecture
-----
sooooooooo
nice
-----
fantastic
professor
-----
if
you've
never
taken
calculus
before
avoid
his
class
at
any
cost
because
you
will
fail
without
an
outside
tutor
i
would
often
get
the
right
answer
to
problems
but
not
take
same
steps
as
what
he
wanted
me
and
a
high
amount
of
points
also
visiting
office
hours
nowhere
he's
just
unhelpful
lectures
-----
wei
literally
reads
from
the
textbook
using
same
exact
examples
and
only
looks
at
board
english
is
poor
tests
are
inconsistent
in
difficulty
i
feel
bad
because
he
such
a
nice
guy
but
don't
take
him
-----
pretty
tough
not
because
he
is
a
hard
grader
or
anything
but
he's
just
that
clear
and
his
tas
are
abysmal
teaches
lectures
straight
out
of
the
textbook
so
if
you
follow
along
with
him
in
lecture
it
isn't
too
bad
also
means
can
skip
class
still
self-teach
curves
up
tests
big
time
cus
everyone
does
terribly
-----
worst
class
i
have
ever
taken
unclear
lectures
and
recitation
was
not
helpful
his
english
extremely
difficult
to
understand
all
he
did
repeat
the
textbook
try
avoid
him
-----
she's
sensational
-----
absolutely
love
her
she
was
so
helpful
getting
me
caught
up
when
i
transferred
into
class
from
the
wait
list
she's
also
incredibly
sweet
and
loves
to
joke
around
with
us
teach
little
korean
culture
tidbits
for
my
future
classes
will
be
trying
hardest
have
possible
-----
she
is
the
best
professor
i
had
in

so
far
a
great
lecturer
and
truly
cares
for
all
her
students

awesome
professor

and

career
fair
grader
i
would
continue
taking
class
with
her
if
could
she's
a
resource
-----
so
much
busy
work
like
an
undergrad
class
don't
take
if
you
have
a
full
schedule
or
it's
just
too
-----
n
a
-----
yeah
who
does
he
think
is
some
kind
of
leading
expert
or
someth
um
ok
delete
that
doesn't
know
about
the
tuition
we
pay
if
i
wanted
to
when
i'm
wrong
could
have
gone
community
college
should
been
more
considerate
my
opinions
ps
jost
brilliant
-----
he
is
simply
brilliant
his
class
was
interesting
and
insightful
comments
always
instigated
great
discussions
passion
about
area
of
research
psychology
in
general
inspiring
it
one
the
best
classes
i
have
ever
taken
-----
sometimes
students
will
say
something
in
class
that
he
disagrees
with
or
goes
against
his
own
research
and
you
can
literally
see
him
trembling
anger
right
before
starts
belittling
their
observation
freaky
weird
-----
patronizing
-----
stay
away--especially
if
it
is
a
small
discussion
group
you
have
any
opinions
of
your
own
he
will
squash
them
and
make
sorry
ever
opened
mouth
in
class
couldn't
stand
this
course
worse
i
took
at
nyu
-----
he
is
authoritarian--really
needed
to
have
tight
control
of
the
discussion
if
could
told
each
person
what
comment
make
would
this
makes
for
a
lousy
discussion-based
class--no
free-flowing
thought
kinda
weird
too
twitches
lot
when
talks
so
i
think
high-strung
in
general
and
defensive
-----
smug
and
authoritarian
is
definately
not
my
impression
of
him
our
class
was
a
good
mix
lecture
discussion
he
adept
at
working
with
student
comments
to
expand
them
into
full
fledged
arguments
he's
earned
his
right
be
bit
intimidating
but
if
you
work
hard
make
an
extremely
approachable
encouraging
-----
major
full-of-himself
pompous
prof
i
hated
this
course
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
in
stern
his
tests
are
super
tough
though
however
i'd
love
to
take
class
again
-----
nice
man
horribly
difficult
exams
attendance
only
mandatory
because
he
gives
daily
quizzes
pretty
easy
graded
leniently
by
ta
lots
of
homework
and
reading
the
text
-----
nicest
professor
ever
from
the
first
day
you
can
tell
that
he
really
wants
his
students
to
do
well
and
learn
attempts
get
know
everyone
as
there
are
online
assignments
quizzes
every
class
-
i'm
grateful
for
it
because
of
them
i
have
a
much
better
understanding
material
than
would
otherwise
-----
he's
the
nicest
guy
on
entire
planet
genuinely
cares
about
his
students
and
their
success
but
don't
let
this
fool
you
course
is
hard
so
are
exams
he
very
specific
in
what
wants
as
answers
to
it
easy

questions
wrong
i
recommend
teacher
underestimate
class
-----
nicest
guy
you'll
ever
meet

with
you
for
help
whenever
he
is
very
highly
recommended
tests
aren't
too
bad
either
-----
awesome
teacher

an
amazing
accent

of
all
the
financial
accounting
teachers
very
straight
forward

i've
had
at
nyu

help
you
great
new

accent
-----
he
was
a
great
professor
always
helpful
outside
of
the
classroom
very
nice
guy
wants
students
to
do
well
-----
a
truly
inspirational
professor
mentor
historian
and
individual
my
seminar
joked
that
she
is
forrest
gump
type
of
character
in
was
always
at
the
right
place
time:
stonewall
riots
la
race
will
add
fascinating
personal
perspective
on
historical
events
let
you
see
history
through
unique
lense
-----
i
strongly
recommend
taking
professor
baar--one
of
the
best
classes
that
have
taken
at
nyu
so
far
-----
i
strongly
recommend
taking
professor
baar
her
class
was
enjoyable
and
insightful
she
really
wants
to
see
students
succeed
is
more
than
willing
help
at
office
hours
one
of
the
best
classes
have
taken
so
far
nyu
-----
i
had
her
as
my
freshman
seminar
teacher
and
couldn't
be
more
happy
won
the
jackpot
with
professor
baar-
she
is
greatest
out
there
i'm
sad
for
all
kids
who
won't
get
chance
to
taught
inspired
by
a
wonderful
human
absolutely
hilarious
will
miss
-----
baar
is
not
just
a
teacher
but
an
inspiration
role
model
friend
goes
above
and
beyond
any
expectations
that
student
has
for
college
professor
i
truly
enjoyed
taking
her
civil
rights
course
only
did
learn
great
deal
was
actually
transformed
into
interest
in
the
topic
if
you
can
take
class
-----
the
best
professor
i
have
had
at
nyu
goes
beyond
genuinely
caring
she
inspires
you
to
think
and
actually
care
about
subject
instead
of
just
droning
on
facts
which
is
what
we
should
be
learning
love
that
it's
not
dates
how
its
why
it
can
help
us
in
modern
day
grow
will
learn
a
better
human
being
-----
genuinely
cares
about
your
success
in
the
course
goes
to
great
lengths
make
you
interested
class
really
knows
her
stuff
and
tells
many
personal
anecdotes
that
i
appreciated
highly
recommend
baar
what
a
gem
-----
super
nice
great
lecturer
the
assignments
are
fun
and
managable
she
has
a
ton
of
inside
knowledge
she'll
even
help
you
with
your
research
up
in
archives
person
to
boot
-
gotta
take
this
class
-----
she
is
an
amazing
professor
one
of
a
kind
genuinely
cares
about
her
students
and
really
un
derstand
that
they
are
there
to
learn
not
fight
for
good
grade
very
smart
has
lot
insight
research
knowledge
high
recommended
-----
i
do
not
doubt
her
knowledge
of
mathematics
as
she
does
have
a
phd
though
ability
to
teach
teaches
straight
out
the
book
explain
tough
concepts
clearly
and
offer
any
methods
interpret
them
other
than
what
offers
should
be
kept
away
from
beginners
math
-
more
advanced
students
are
ok
-----
this
was
one
of
the
best
courses
i
have
taken
at
nyu
prof
lushi
taught
us
about
many
math
models
used
in
real
world
applications
learned
things
including
matlab
programming
and
typing
latex
final
project
presentation
are
useful
to
put
my
resume
too
owe
professor
a
big
thanks
for
course
-----
okay
teacher
doesn't
put
much
effort
into
teaching
unless
you
really
press
her
for
it
the
lectures
is
exactly
same
as
book
which
a
great
thing
me
since
i
hate
reading
exam
questions
are
quite
easy
they
very
similar
to
homework
-----
she
is
a
great
professor
and
caring
of
students
learning
i
struggled
to
understand
the
textbook
by
myself
so
lectures
were
super
helpful
luckily
prof
made
very
clear
in
about
what
we
absolutely
needed
learn
that
helped
me
do
well
exams
course
-----
she
is
great
at
what
does
and
very
helpful
if
the
effort
put
in
you
will
learn
a
lot
prof
lushi
has
inspired
me
to
further
pursue
math
-----
first
of
all
she's
not
a
good
lecturer
if
you
go
to
class
chances
are
you're
either
going
fall
asleep
or
wish
could
be
doing
something
else
reads
her
lectures
right
out
the
textbooks
which
is
why
almost
half
never
comes
fair
grader
so
really
do
know
what
you'll
easily
pass
-----
midterm
was
very
tough
but
fair
because
she
had
covered
similar
questions
in
class
homework
can
be
long
-----
she
is
a
good
teacher
explains
things
clearly
helpful
in
office
hours
lots
of
homework
but
tests
are
ok
fair
grading
and
nice
policy
dropping
lowest
quiz
assignment
scores
class
attendance
not
mandatory
exam
questions
easier
if
you
follow
the
examples
from
lectures
-----
prof
lushi
is
not
the
best
lecturer
basically
reads
off
txtbook
and
its
examples
but
she
wants
to
help
u
learn
tests
you
on
what
taught
in
lectures
as
long
can
do
hwk
will
fine
your
pretty
easy
dont
underestimate
class
if
go
fall
behind
definitely
fail
-----
fritz
is
great
he's
very
animated
and
detail
oriented
not
at
time
management
known
to
have
an
angry
burst
from
but
generally
what
he
says
gold
got
a
eye
for
theater
directing
-----
fritz
is
a
cool
guy
and
smart
but
i
don't
think
he
very
good
at
critiquing
work
in
feedback
that
gave
me
generally
seemed
to
totally
miss
the
point
of
my
choices
even
though
other
teachers
peers
completely
understood
because
this
never
really
said
anything
helpful
-----
fritz
is
an
absolutely
genius
listen
to
everything
he
says
-----
pretty
regular
a
little
limited
in
feedback
but
always
willing
to
answer
questions
specific
your
own
growth
as
an
actor
-----
pentecost
was
an
amazing
experience
thanks
fritz
-----
no
comments
-----
one
of
the
most
useful
classes
i've
taken
thus
far
a
great
teacher
an
honest
who's
not
afraid
to
tell
you
that
screwed
up
and
then
lead
your
own
conclusions
about
how
fix
it
:
-----
fritz
is
incredible
if
you
don't
immediately
love
him
really
can't
call
yourself
an
artist
and
should
leave
the
field
-----
my
most
frustating
class
but
that's
not
the
teacher's
fault
he's
a
good
man
and
teacher
-----
watching
geluso
speak
is
an
adventure
he
super
passionate
well-respected
and
experienced
his
lectures
often
incorporate
stories
of
experiences
while
explanations
are
a
little
hard
to
follow
interesting
i
had
him
for
class
that
was
easy
enough
it
didn't
matter
textbook
wasn't
used
at
all
-----
i've
heard
many
great
things
about
professor
geluso
and
can
see
why
he
is
very
passionate
teaching
music
tech
has
lots
of
to
say
however
for
me
be
hard
follow
in
class
as
brushes
through
the
slides
talks
a
lot
someone
who
isn't
an
auditory
learner
i
had
do
outside
reading
-----
geluso's
not
the
best
at
explaining
concepts
but
try
to
pay
attention
in
class
or
read
textbook
because
his
slides
are
pretty
useless
when
it
comes
studying
for
exams
he's
extremely
knowledgeable
though
and
fun
cool
condescending
all
always
telling
sorts
of
interesting
stories
he
worked
with
famous
artists
-----
mr
geluso
is
a
gifted
instructor
he
really
knows
what
he's
doing
and
also
does
not
attempt
to
bs
you
obviously
has
continual
thirst
for
knowledge
because
constantly
referring
things
reading
or
read
very
brilliant
easy
get
along
with
-----
the
class
is
easy
and
if
you
listen
to
him
his
stories
about
working
in
studios
you'll
find
that
he
knows
so
effin'
much
has
been
game
for
a
while
by
far
one
of
most
valuable
teachers
here
-----
didn't
do
much
other
than
listen
to
his
sometimes
questionable
opinion
-----
10
out
of
music
tech
students
agree
paul
is
the
best
teacher
to
get
in
program
really
knows
his
stuff
extremely
nice
good
sense
humor
attendance
policy
lax
everything
actually
but
at
same
time
there
a
lot
high
quality
material
he
teaches
you
will
learn
-----
even
though
he
laughs
at
his
own
jokes
is
willing
to
help
and
you
can
skip
class
here
there
-----
nice
guy
good
teacher
-----
he's
a
nice
guy
and
he
generally
gives
good
grades
still
the
material
is
extremely
boring
some
people
enjoy
it
that's
fine
but
lot
of
were
quite
bored
if
you're
interested
in
philosophy
theory
behind
performances
then
by
all
means
take
this
class
otherwise
you
won't
really
readings
will
be
chore
-----
sweetest
guy
knows
what
he's
talking
about
all
you
could
ask
for
in
a
class
on
realism
and
naturalism--
come
people
its
not
like
another
teacher
would
make
it
breathtakingly
exciting
this
is
worth
taking
learn
lot
by
reading
though
never
mandatory
often
want
to
great
-----
genuinely
nice
guy
though
class
can
be
quite
boring
still
movie
screening
days
are
optional
and
he
picks
some
unusual
adaptations
-----
genuinely
nice
person
means
well
helps
alot
he
doesnt
like
to
give
bad
grades
really
trying
teach
people
i
think
is
just
a
sweetheart
-----
he
is
the
sweetest
man
wants
you
to
do
well
and
very
understanding
a
tad
boring
until
class
makes
it
interesting
by
really
getting
into
discussions
intelligent
gets
excited
when
says
something
witty
take
-----
he
is
a
really
nice
guy
and
has
some
witty
moments
but
for
the
most
part
material
not
that
interesting
if
there
was
more
discussion
class
would
be
exciting
-----
warning
stay
away
a
total
bloviating
prig
why
is
he
teaching
theater
typical
academic
totally
out
of
touch
with
the
nyu
drama
student
-----
no
comments
-----
i
found
it
very
difficult
to
focus
in
this
class
professor
has
a
quiet
manner
and
doesn't
speak
clearly
concisely
find
struggle
stay
awake
almost
every
lecture
most
of
what
learned
from
the
readings
that
had
do
for
papers
not
if
you
like
learning
during
take
another
course
-----
all
comments
are
completely
true
hard
grader
basically
wants
a
paper
on
his
views
which
can
get
very
frustrating
readings
useless
repeats
himself
many
times
in
unorganized
lectures
yet
gives
helpful
sheets
of
notes
nice
old
man
who
to
help:
will
preread
your
whole
if
you
write
what
he
you'll
an
-----
i
had
him
for
ancient
egyptian
religion
and
his
class
was
actually
pretty
good
the
notes
he
makes
them
before
hand
can
be
very
helpful
when
writing
papers
provides
all
readings
bibliography
which
is
also
as
it
saves
student
time
finding
texts
by
themselves
an
easy
grader
or
at
least
fair
-----
while
he
knows
what
he's
talking
about
a
hard
grader
who
gives
boring
lecture
an
hour-long
class
became
torture
so
view
of
the
clock
is
must
nice
man
but
definitely
stuck
in
1950s
academia
i'd
stay
away
if
you
can
-----
makes
a
potentially
interesting
topic
painful
course
is
poorly
designed
class
based
on
3
papers
so
reading
useless
except
for
those
assignments
if
attendance
weren't
taken
i
wouldn't
bother
going

professor
goelet
is
very
knowledged
and
passionate
on
this
subject
as
well
with
his
job
he
always
willing
to
help
the
classes
can
be
a
bit
tedious
at
times
my
one
complaint
large
amount
of
work
for
an
introductory
class
six
papers
in
semester
-----
very
difficult
grader
but
always
willing
to
help

tedious

end
of

the
class
is
fantastic
professor
goelet
takes
time
to
give
students
all
information
necessary
and
beyond
what
needed
in

very
interesting

don't
take
him
morning
becasue
it

a
history

it's
cool
to
meet
someone
so
incredibly
knowledgable
about
such
a
niche
subject
as
max
msp
well
just
digital
audio
in
general
dude
is
smart
super
funny
and
little
awkward
the
more
you

thrives
on
questions
gives
great
feedback
not
harsh
grader
easy-ish
homework
very
reasonable
guy

very
knowledgeable
in

sometimes
goes
quickly
through

up
confusion

he
is
accessible
for
help
if
need
be
don't
make
a
project
until
the
last
2
weeks

he's
wicked
smart
at
max
msp
programming
and
could
answer
any
question
you
throw
him
but
burns
through
a
lot
of
information
very
rapidly
each

to
the
point
can't
quite
catch
it
all
first

great
professor
he's
extremely
knowledgeable
in

of
the
few

frequently

tour
performing
with
broken
bells
not

shins

wonderful
educator

carolina

the
best

she's
clear
extremely

and
fair
she
super
nice
but
don't

he
is
very
unclear
during

poorly

i
love
jay
as
a
person
he's
the
best
but
he
is
really
fit
for
small
lectures
didn't
come
across
same
in
giant
texts
and
ideas

his
this
big

jay

prof
marcelle
is
super
intelligent
and
nice
he
talks
about
lots
of
trendy
events
there're
choices
topics
for
the
final
paper
weekly
responses
are
not
graded
based
on
quality--you
just
do
it
but
you'd
better
take
notes
carefully
during
lectures
because
puts
some
ideas
altogether
always
humorous
-----
tbh
he
isn't
that
great
he's
an
easy
a
but
i
didn't
learn
anything
in
class
and
would
never
take
again
people
will
rate
him
high
bc
it's
super
it
was
so
boring
not
worth
my
time
at
all
because
doesn't
actually
teach
-----
brilliant
teacher
kind
and
flexible
beyond
reason
need
extra
time
no
problem
can't
make
it
to
class
we
all
have
bad
days
reading
is
encouraged
but
not
required
he
engages
mostly
in
relevant
conversation
topics
tries
his
best
explain
philosophers'
ideas
contemporary
terms
don't
be
scared
by
orthopedic
shoes
he's
a
darling
-----
this
prof
is
so
great
one
of
the
best
teachers
i
had
at
nyu
would
100%
take
his
class
again
definitely
read
in
order
to
get
most
out
it
you
dont
have
if
want
participate
makes
fun
man
a
genius
he
really
knows
what
hes
talking
about
and
also
extremely
passionate
good
who
loves
job
-----
great
professor
guy
one
of
the
few
i
went
to
consistently
amazes
me
how
he
knows
so
much
about
content
lectures
exact
length
class
without
notes
and
can
still
break
it
down
into
very
easy
understand
clearly
defined
concepts
reading
not
necessary
just
take
good
pay
attention
favorite
by
far
-----
he
is
a
real
gem
probably
one
of
the
most
knowledgeable
people
i
have
ever
met
which
knows
loves
to
drop
off
fun
facts
about
world
in
his
lectures
do
not
be
afraid
participate
it
makes
class
more
and
think
enjoys
that
way
will
often
crack
at
political
jokes
-----
only
have
some
short
responses
for
completion
marks
the
midterm
graded
tough
and
final
essay
lectures
extremely
boring
very
hard
to
understand
point
you
do
readings
first
half
of
semester
but
there
are
a
lot
super
nice
person
not
great
teacher
doesn't
always
take
attendance
-----
i
took
this
prof
for
mcb2
his
lectures
were
really
interesting
he
made
such
complex
concepts
digestible
slides
can
be
daunting
but
if
you
just
focus
on
what
says
during
lecture
recordings
and
you'll
fine
often
calls
testable
material
'his
favorite'
so
the
lookout
that
-----
prof
christiaen
was
an
amazing
professor
-
the
material
for
his
portion
of
dev
bio
really
difficult
but
he
great
at
breaking
down
concepts
and
making
them
relatively
simple
to
understand
he's
also
very
funny
textbook
wasn't
necessary
helped
tests
were
fair
pay
attention
in
lecture
re-watch
recordings
-----
the
more
classes
i
take
at
nyu
appreciate
him
lectures
are
dense
but
very
clear
and
interesting
he
repeats
important
concepts
so
you
on
what
to
study
for
exams
i'm
sad
that
he's
not
teaching
:
-----
his
teaching
style
overall
takes
some
getting
used
to
the
lectures
are
very
clear
well-structured
and
informational
also
slips
in
sassy
comments
jokes
monotone
tests
were
not
memory-based
but
focus
on
experimental
design
logic
i
didn't
like
him
much
during
mcb
ii
definitely
enjoyed
devbio
a
lot
-----
explains
concepts
decently
-
most
of
the
time
best
to
go
lectures
and
ask
questions
because
he
leaves
gaps
in
knowledge
+
textbook
sucks
his
recordings
fail
quite
often
good
thing
is
he's
v
clear
about
what
considers
testable
info
so
it's
easy
predict
do
any
all
practice
exams
you
can
find
repeats
-----
squeezes
a
lot
of
detail
into
his
lectures
the
subject
is
bit
complex
but
he
does
good
job
making
it
easier
to
understand
textbook
use
depends
on
your
learning
style
i
got
by
with
mostly
just
lecture
slides
tests
are
tough
so
be
very
thorough
when
studying
-----
very
clear
mostly
focuses
on
broader
concepts
rather
than
specific
details
the
lecture
slides
are
most
important
so
don't
really
worry
about
book
too
much
-----
your
grade
for
this
class
is
only
based
on
two
things:
midterm
and
final
there
not
a
lot
of
opportunity
to
boost
even
if

well

not

he's

to
go

it's
hard

really
nice

his

and
approachable
he's
a
close
friend
to
many
of
the
china

quite
some

incredibly
smart
guy
his
lectures
are
very
well-organized
and
informative
he
assigns
a
ton
of
reading
but
i
ended
doing
it
all
because
the
books
were
so
good

well
worth

terrible
all
around
condescending
even
if
you
are
a
hard
worker
does
not
explain
things
clearly
mistakes
in
slides
which
extremely
disorganized
when
people
ask
her
questions
she
tries
to
shut
them
up
so
have
answer
and
makes
feel
bad
about
it
on
top
of
any
other
professor
but
ugh
-----
i
liked
this
professor
in
the
beginning
but
then
learned
how
unflexible
she
is
always
talks
soft
voice
so
it
can
seem
like
being
nice
actually
talking
down
to
you
her
lectures
are
disorganized
and
hard
follow
boring
only
good
thing
that
wrote
book
its
a
repeat
of
lecture

agree
with
everyone
else
she
is
very
spacey
disorganized
unclear
and
it's
a
drag
to
sit
through
her
class
can
patronize
disrespect
you
all
while
smiling
speaking
softy
my
guess
always
trying
reduce
vocal
effort

still
wanting
take
jabs

she
is
one
of
the
worst
teachers
i
have
ever
had
totally
unorganized
patronizing
and
downright
bizarre
not
helpful

spirited
-----
unorganized
unhelpful
unfair
mean
makes
a
lot
of
mistakes
and
will
never
admit
to
them
on
test
if
you
wrote
something
from
your
notes
she
marks
as
wrong
but
show
her
it
was
what
mentioned
in
class
points
not
be
rewarded
total
****
-----
she
really
wants
you
to
learn
the
material
which
is
great
but
doesn't
know
how

it
will
make
errors
all
over

chris
is
fantastic
-----
my
favorite
class
since
starting
film
ma-
her
focuses
are
more
interdisciplinary
interesting
and
evocative
she
is
easy
going
fluid
open
to
hearing
other
perspectives
allows
students
take
ownership
of
their
own
work
focus
on
interests
really
cool

it
a
lot
but
it's
exciting
invigorating
-----
one
of
best
profs
i
ever
had
in
film
school
a
life
changer
-----
i
took
the
almodovar
class
with
her
in
summer
term
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
she
really
makes
sure
you're
doing
reading
and
more
or
less
forces
you
to
participate
so
definitely
keep
that
mind
but
also
emphasizes
values
than
final
paper
trade-off
there
great
is
good
professor
--
take
-----
film
theory
is
a
difficult
class
that
very
dense
in
its
concepts
and
readings
but
prof
straayer
attempts
to
make
it
understandable
for
us
poor
undergrad
students
the
most
part
succeeds
lectures
bit
long
sometimes
dull
grade
based
on
two
papers
which
seems
daunting
it's
really
not
awful
-----
billy
is
really
friendly
and
easy-going
class
pretty
straight-forward
it's
very
easy
to
get
a
good
grade
overall
you
definitely
learn
couple
of
things
don't
usually
think
about
i
highly
recommend
him
his
snarky
sense
humor
sincerity
towards
students
make
interesting
fun
attend
-----
he's
super
clever
almost
to
a
fault
but
will
teach
you
how
rock
any
interview
funny
and
engaging
teacher
who
unlike
many
nyu
professors
acknowledges
that
his
class
is
not
the
be-all-end-all
of
higher
education
rather
great
opportunity
learn
useful
life
skills
definitely
recommended
-----
if
you
take
interviewing
strategies
be
sure
to
get
billy
the
class
was
not
only
fun
but
helpful
he
isn't
out

very
fun

our
class
enjoyable
tried
to
be
funny
always
willing
answer
my
questions
and
available
for
appointments

always
has
helped
me
out
and
i
can
get
an
appointment
when
need
one
much
cooler
than
the
other
ones
responds
to
my
email
questions
-----
worst
advisor
ever
won't
make
time
for
you
and
when
he
does
not
know
the
answer
to
any
of
your
questions
tells
go
elsewhere
stick
with
one
other
advisors
who
has
been
there
a
little
longer
billy
needs
lose
attitude
-----
universally
beloved
and
rightfully
so
if
you
show
up
pay
attention
in
class
take
some
light
notes
you'll
learn
a
lot
do
very
well
on
tests
don't
really
can
honestly
still
pass

most
mundane
topics

sense
of
humor

he
is
funny
with
puns

course
interesting
but
also
very
confusing

of
math
which
i
am
terrible
at

and
all
these
material
are
new
to
my

while
it
is
easy
to
get
a
good
grade
you
cannot
help
but
learning
in
his
classes
the
reviewer
who
claimed

he
can't
help
that
his
class
is
somewhat
boring

why

for
calc
iii
which
is
a
tough
subject
to
begin
with
i
felt
she
explained
everything
pretty
well
but
definitely
take
advantage
of
office
hours
clarification--she
goes
over
things
really
quickly
in

challenging
tries
make
it
as
manageable
possible
recommend
-----
took
quantitative
reasoning:
math
patterns
in
nature
with
her
the
class
was
really
easy
but
frustrating
because
moved
so
slowly
full
of
useless
information
too
definitely
what
you
want
to
take
if
you're
not
a
person
and
don't
care
about
learning
-----
way
too
much
work
and
not
enough
explaining
but
if
you
get
it
all
done
-
with
other
ppl
youll
be
fine
meet
her
she'll
explain
a
lot
better
-----
very
nice
and
approachable
but
not
good
at
explaining
she's
a
bit
too
tough
on
grading
considering
what
we
learn
in
lecture
is
basic
compared
to
the
application
problems
exams
-----
this
was
her
first
semester
to
teach
she
is
very
nice
but
an
extremely
tough
grader
and
creates
hw
problems
far
beyond
what
taught
in
class
i
get
it
that
trying
push
the
students
no
time
spent
reviewing
work
ensure
we
understand
have
math
accurate

an
amazing
professor

makes
the
subject
really
enjoyable

fun
i
wouldn't
say
its
easy
a
but
it's
definitely
class
where
if
you
put
in
time
do
readings
will
get
people
told
me
it
was
that's
misleading
-
requires
to
keep
up
with
produce
good
essays

he
makes
an
uninteresting
subject
at
least
for
me
very
interesting
by
teaching
us
the

a
clear
concise
and
relatable
manner
yeah
history
can
be
boring

knows
how

very
manageable

as
long

had
him
for
texts
and
ideas
which
is
a
class
everyone
hates
lecture
not
mandatory
but
i
actually
loved
attending
them
the
concepts
he
talks
ab
are
extremely
interesting
thought
provoking
readings
long
complicated
would
definitely
take
w
again
he's
very
man
with
lot
to
say

his
lectures
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
readings
and
he
just
rambles
on
repeating
same
ideas
what
a
waste
of
time
attending
class
most
useless
ive
taken
thus
far
-----
his
lectures
are
not
the
most
exciting
things
in

if
you
actually
pay
attention
and
listen
to
what
he
is
saying
talks
about
some
really
interesting
concepts
it
can
be
tempting

a
little
hard

him
for
commenting
something
on

-----
professor
thomas
is
one
of
the
best
professors
ive
ever

more
concerned

he
uses
his
lectures

30%
stand-up
routine
20%
side-tracked
rambles
and
50%
actually
teaching
though
the
portion

probably
because
he's
part-time
professor

the
lectures
are
structured

grade
destroying
errors

young
ambitious
and
very
hard
working

doesn't
check
adequately
before
handing

prove
disastrous
for

worst
in

career
part
due

error
laden
exams

is
a
challenging
subject
to
begin
with

made
it
understandable
and
clear
as
long
students

their
homework
tests
become
less
because
for
practice
even
though
fairly
new
at
teaching
he
knows
his

would
definitely
take
another

each
meeting
there's
extra

-----
he
is
unclear
about
some
concepts
and
will
just
point
you

hard
understand
him
sometimes

this
was
a
really
fun
class
anirudh
great
with

reviews

are
pretty
spiteful

in
all
honesty
he
just
seems
to
have
lost
his
connection
with
kids
class
simply
isnt
taught
lets
speak
most
of
time
and
then
adds
filler
by
either
showing
clips
from
films
or
talking
about
2
textbooks
you
learn
little
nothing

shut
down
and
became
abrasive
rude
unavailable

all
feel
very
comfortable

about

hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
professors
class
was
always
engaging

experiences
allowed
us
to
do
the

textbook
isn't
used
much

-----
deanie
is
the
sweetest
teacher
ever

super
fun
i
actually
loved
going
to
everyday
textbook
not
really
necessary
for
any
assignments
although
reading
it
helpful
contribute
discussions
-----
deanie
is
an
extremely
helpful
and
friendly
professor
while
it's
difficult
to
meet
with
her
outside
class
she
readily
sets
aside
time
for
students
when

professor
hannah

interesting
guy

really
cool
and
important
jobs
working
for
joe
biden

the
lectures
are
little
heavy
dry
but
when
comes
to
exams
final
paper
very
clear
with
what
expects
not
tough
grader
-----
uncharismatic
so
his
lectures
can
get
a
little
boring
in
class
discussions
are
fairly
straightforward
participation
is
easy
readings
redundant
but
reading
through
them
before
the
tests
helps
bunch
changed
schedule
syllabus
too
many
times
similar
to
what
was
said
doesn't
hold
himself
accountable
for
lost
time
-----
not
in
terms
of
grading
policy
or
what
he
wants
tests
often
won't
be
held
accountable
for
mistakes
a
bit
pretentious
and
over
complicates
answers
still
very
knowledgable
-----
he's
super
smart
and
nice
definitely
knows
what
talking
about
i
just
wish
the
class
was
a
little
more
discussion
based
relevant
rather
than
lecture
enjoyed
lot
but
feel
like
could
have
learned
if
he
took
out
of
textbook
-----
she
was
such
a
nice
lady
but
i
didn't
jibe
with
her
teaching
style
we
did
lot
of
reading
then
would
come
into
class
and
just
discuss
it
together
felt
like
learn
much
because
wasn't
at
all
discussion
an
unexpectedly
hard
essay
grader
midterm
very
easy
-----
she
is
so
nice
caring
and
well-prepared
love
her
readings
are
sometimes
boring
to
be
honest;
but
thats
basically
all
the
in
cf
mythology
stuffs
already
gives
out
best
can
make
them
more
attractive
not
that
much
reading
tough
grader
for
papers
if
you
want
easy
a
don
take
-----
she's
nice
smart
and
organized
her
classes
are
interesting
generally
discussion
based
super
reasonable
-
allows
up
to
3
excused
absences
will
be
flexible
if
you
need
something
not
big
on
tests
but
should
take
the
essays
seriously
because
they're
most
of
your
grade
really
great
class
would
recommend
-----
rockstar
presented
us
with
very
interesting
readings
that
i
would
not
have
found
otherwise
extremely
helpful
and
readily
available
to
talk
students
outside
of
class
-----
watching
him
unveil
his
mind
and
explain
complex
thought
process
on
the
board
is
fascinating
has
inspired
me
to
approach
mathematics
as
i
have
never
approached
it
before
professor
was
very
communicative
quick
answer
my
many
emails
always
willing
help
kind
which
reinforcing
during
a
rough
patch
in
life
-----
he
taught
my
honors
algebra
i
class
at
nyu
great
professor
nice
guy
obviously
knows
his
stuff
lecture
notes
was
in
light
of
the
otherwise
pretty
useless
textbook
available
office
hours
take
when
teaches
it
only
real
complaint
that
hw
really
too
easy
for
could
afford
to
let
us
learn
more
-----
his
algebra
class
was
my
favorite
i
have
taken
in
nyu
he
posted
lecture
notes
online
which
good
enough
that
didn't
even
really
had
to
read
the
textbook
homework
a
little
bit
on
easier
side;
it
mostly
prove
this
fits
definition
also
seems
like
nice
person
highly
recommended
-----
i
took
zappa's
algebra
class
in
spring
2017one
of
the
best
experiences
have
had
at
nyu
he
was
very
friendly
explained
all
concepts
patiently
and
lucidly
accessible
office
hours
specific
about
what
we
should
study
or
review
empathized
with
us
that
reading
textbooks
dry
made
his
lectures
self-sufficient
-----
excellent
teacher
-----
my
favorite
teacher
at
nyu
he's
compassionate
enthusiastic
and
funny
i
will
always
remember
him
google
his
name
for
some
interesting
reads
was
blessed
to
have
adult
lab
as
well
elder
clinical
ny
downtown
think
did
more
in
that
one
than
all
the
others
combined
he
made
me
do
everything
i'm
grateful
-----
hands
down
the
best
not
a
single
negative
thing
to
say
-----
three
words:
can
you
imagine
lmao
he
is
an
interesting
character
really
funny
or
corny
depending
on
your
type
of
humor
very
smart
and
knows
his
stuff
will
definitely
learn
a
lot
from
him
wait
till
see
this
man
-----
emily
is
nice
and
caring
but
for
the
essays
it's
hard
to
know
what
she
likes
hopes
read
lectures
are
good
not
related
-----
you
need
to
write
in
the
way
she
likes
order
get
a
good
grade
also
i
don't
like
teaches
treats
middle
school
student
which
makes
me
feel
stupid
-----
professor
emily
stone
clearly
has
her
own
outstanding
understanding
of
how
an
essay
should
be
structured
yet
whether
this
system
standards
is
truly
objective
or
valuable
debatable
apparently
knows
that
all
students
are
idiots
she
to
pay
efforts
on
so
a
minimal
b
score
would
the
best
gift
could
give
-----
emily
was
very
friendly
but
she
can
be
a
tough
grader
ready
for
weekly
assignments
and
to
participate
in
class
the
worst
part
that
isn't
great
at
giving
feedback
on
drafts
of
essays
so
make
sure
you
ask
questions
want
answers
majority
your
grade
is
based
3
write
keep
up
with
work
-----
peter
is
one
of
my
favorite
professors
at
nyu
he
kind
passionate
and
interesting
cares
about
his
students
both
in
class
life
though
sometimes
could
be
unclear
but
never
that
strict
on
grading
-
just
wants
people
to
do
things
they
care
i
not
know
why
there
are
so
many
negative
comments
here
enjoyed
-----
this
is
the
worst
professor
i
have
ever
had
period
there
are
no
guidelines
for
class
and
he
doesn't
do
anything
to
help
that
either
basically
a
meaningless
seems
personal
vendettas
against
certain
students
as
incredibly
rude
singles
them
out
in
while
lets
others
get
away
with
offensive
comments
avoid
-----
this
teacher
was
possibly
the
most
frustrating
and
confusing
i
have
ever
had
assignments
are
incredibly
unclear
on
website
when
asked
for
clarification
he
sent
me
same
link
about
is
always
late
to
class
never
apologizes
overall
very
bleak
pessimistic
would
not
recommend
anyone
-----
peter
is
the
worst
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
class
i
took
no
guidelines
actual
syllabus
and
was
generally
useless
his
demeanor
exceedingly
negative
he
singles
out
students
with
justification
did
not
feel
motivated
to
participate
nor
like
could
ask
questions
clarify
things
big
letdown
-----
1
he
gave
homework
exercise
during
the
lecture
and
you
dont
need
to
do
all
of
them
can
choose
by
yourself
however
is
only
increase
your
final
score
so
not
afraid
doing
problems
wrong
2
extremely
easy
it
again
as
a
take-home
grade
-----
unlike
many
star
mathematicians
professor
cappell
obviously
enjoys
teaching
undergraduates
he
has
a
knack
for
simplifying
complex
material
so
that
3rd4th
year
math
majors
can
understand
it
while
also
pushing
them
beyond
what
they
think
do
-
wo
overdoing
hw
is
assigned
but
stopped
collecting
&
very
generous
with
grades
-----
in
the
second
semester
prof
cappell
became
slightly
less
organized
than
first
probably
because
if
he
didn't
get
to
anything
could
push
it
off
but
no
longer
had
this
lifeline
nevertheless
still
remained
very
clear
and
gave
good
intuition
however
there
was
basically
homework
-----
prof
cappell
is
one
of
the
most
brilliant
lecturers
i
have
had
pleasure
having
as
a
teacher
although
he
makes
entire
lecture
up
on
spot
flows
incredibly
smoothly
and
can
just
sit
back
bask
in
amazing
clarity
that
sylvain
not
too
much
homework
was
given
to
reinforce
material
however
-----
first
of
all
she
does
not
give
1
guidelines
for
presentations
papers
etc
2
if
she's
against
certain
topic
criticizes
it
3
were
way
too
long
and
doesn't
even

any
feedback

5-7pages

-----
easy
grader
really
available
fun
class
she
is
one
of
the
very
few
professors
that
kept
me
awake
in
-----
great
professorhe
is
very
demanding
and
really
pushes
you
to
learn
caring
helpful
but
the
student
must
work
hard
follow
course
-----
no
comments
-----
do
not
take
this
class
if
you're
a
beginner
is
the
kind
of
where
you
need
to
know
basics
will
barely
follow
carlos
helpful
and
prefers
speak
with
students
who
are
already
little
fluent
he
has
caustic
style
does
make
confortable
overall
i
am
disappointed
-----
fabio
is
an
incredible
professor
he
always
talks
about
interesting
things
in
class
and
never
boring
the
only
problem
that
he's
incredibly
harsh
grader
for
no
reason
-----
professor
parasecoli
is
as
well-read
he
kind
lectures
and
their
associated
topics
representations
of
food
in
the
media
are
very
compelling
grades
based
on
2
medium
papers
1
7-10
research
paper
a
presentation
participation
lots
work
for
credit
class
but
fair
grader
who
accepts
late
makes
it
a-okay
-----
fabio
is
one
of
the
most
friendly
approachable
helpful
teachers
i've
ever
had
along
with
being
smartest
to
point
that
it
frightens
his
students
he'd
never
admit
but
he
knows
pretty
much
everything
really
-----
valeria
is
simply
amazing
she
was
the
sweetest
smartest
ta
i've
ever
had
incredibly
understanding
and
helpful
in
all
circumstances
-----
really
nice
kind
of
hard
to
follow
at
times
due
the
speed
which
she
talks
but
very
willing
help
-----
she's
a
lot
of
fun
and
she
tries
her
best
to
help
you
with
everything
might
have
do
more
studying
grammar
on
your
own
bc
we
jump
around
in
the
textbook
but
very
fair
learn
from
-----
i
had
professor
kopcke
for
the
freshman
seminar
agamemnon
to
alexander
he
was
really
helpful
took
a
genuine
interest
in
each
student's
progress
and
went
out
of
his
way
assist
research
is
extremely
knowledgeable
makes
subject
matter
clear
incredibly
interesting
-----
what
a
wonderful
compelling
and
passionate
class
the
readings
might
be
extensive
but
care
thought
professor
puts
in
his
makes
up
for
work
introduction
to
school
-----
his
class
is
philosophical
and
thought
provoking
really
about
the
art
-----
clear
patient
passionate
and
motivated
to
see
students
succeed
in
french
clever
woman
also
wrote
an
awesome
book
she
enjoys
helping
will
go
out
of
her
way
help
you
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
had
very
passionate
and
helpful
-----
she's
an
awesome
teacher
her
class
rocked
my
world
-----
excellent
devoted
and
fair
professor
clearly
puts
in
a
lot
of
time
to
her
lectures
unlike
what
commenters
said
is
very
open
alternative
perspectives
this
not
an
easy
class
but
it's
worthwhile
also
she
looks
young
i
know
she's
taught
several
years
at
nyu
-----
grading
at
nyu
paris
is
done
whimsically
and
aggressively
in
order
to
maintain
the
appearance
of
a
serious
program
arbitrarily
limits
number
students
that
can
perform
well
grade
wise
despite
their
actual
academic
performance
she
not
yet
able
teach
effectively
certainly
incapable
or
unwilling
give
helpful
feedback
too
you
-----
disorganized
tries
but
lacks
the
experience
and
skills
to
adequately
teach
or
communicate
her
ideas
teaches
art
history
as
part
of
cf
has
no
understanding
how
look
at
heavy
reading
load
which
is
rarely
discussed
not
open
other
even
with
convincing
evidence
should
be
okay
after
she's
matured
-----
avoid
this
teacher
-----
horrible
tests
seems
to
help
but
don't
really
suppose
be
a
elective
hardest
course
i
ever
did
because
it
was
boring
and
seemed
have
no
use
anything
-----
i
always
felt
like
came
away
from
the
class
knowing
something
new
and
useful
which
cant
honestly
say
for
every
ive
taken
in
mcc
department
-----
he
takes
attendance
and
the
two
tests
have
a
lot
of
information
but
if
you
semi-pay
attention
in
class
you'll
be
fine
there
is
also
research
paper
on
exams
to
write
an
essay
don't
read
articles
sends
do
well
this
basically
media
technology
through
ages
it's
pretty
interesting
-----
the
new
media
research
studio
is
awesome
yes
there
slightly
more
work
than
average
but
he
a
very
fair
grader
and
totally
clear
in
class
make
sure
you
do
readings
though
since
they're
what
up
entirety
of
midterm
final
learn
ton
cool
stuff
this
that
you're
not
going
to
find
any
other
classes
-----
don't
take
the
new
media
research
studio
class
i
think
he's
not
really
clear
enough
with
grading
guidelines
and
expects
more
than
anyone
he
nice
guy
knowledgable
but
definitely
still
finding
his
feet
as
a
teacher
young
-----
i
took
his
basic
probability
and
enjoyed
it
the
textbook
is
like
an
encyclopedia
hard
to
read
but
class
made
things
much
easier
homework
can
be
difficult
after
some
work
began
appreciate
for
learned
many
cool
tricks
i'm
not
sure
about
calc1
though
maybe
those
freshmen
are
used
college
math
classes
yet
-----
the
recitations
were
helpful
in
that
they
did
written
homework
for
you
quizzes
easy
and
definitely
manageable
because
same
as
however
final
is
by
a
different
professor
our
class
was
no
way
prepared
what
hit
us
he's
nice
guy
but
his
teaching
skills
aren't
great
-----
nice
guy
super
easy
midterms
decently
quizzes
in
lecture
he
goes
over
proofs
as
opposed
to
practical
applications
which
means
i
stopped
going
class
for
the
most
part
final
calc
at
nyu
is
really
difficult
but
you'll
be
fine
if
you
do
hw
and
study
a
bit
-----
she
knows
her
material
and
can
tell
if
you
do
the
readings
or
not
compared
to
other
professors
explained
how
read
journal
articles
understand
datacharts
pushed
students
learn
language
of
ir
very
helpful
for
those
from
a
diff
field
final
paper
at
end
makes
up
most
your
grade
too
tough
grader
-----
professor
tyler
has
certainly
shaped
my
understanding
of
the
world
and
it's
nice
that
even
when
we
are
discussing
tragedies
genocidal
proportions
she
can
still
work
in
some
deadpan
humor
take
her
class
-----
i
learned
a
lot
from
her
more
than
any
of
my
other
classes
combined
she
seemed
strict
at
first
but
after
gets
to
know
you
is
pretty
flexible
and
understanding
had
the
liveliest
discussions
in
class
vs
courses
-----
janos
is
basically
the
man
because
he
promotes
a
fun
learning
environment
that
actually
conducive
to
positive
outcomes
take
his
class
if
you
get
chance
he's
very
understanding
about
deadlines
and
enjoyable
-----
funny
smart
and
trs
witty
classes
are
always
amusing
-----
awesome
prof
-----
i
really
enjoyed
prof
george
definitely
take
her
if
you
have
the
choice
she
provides
helpful
feedback
and
tailors
class
to
students'
abilities
is
also
head
of
undergrad
department
so
a
great
connection
your
final
grade
will
depend
on
personal
improvement
no
matter
level
can
do
well
-----
the
professor
is
mostly
nice
though
a
bit
stiff
but
class
itself
felt
outdated
and
often
boring
not
much
choice
in
program
other
classes
i've
taken
were
far
better
-----
undoubtedly
the
best
professor
i've
ever
had
and
class
taken
cares
about
her
students
like
they're
children
every
was
fun
engaging
educational
she's
a
once
in
college
career
type
of
you'd
be
making
terrible
mistake
not
taking
regardless
what
it
is
-----
she
lectures
all
the
time
doesn't
appreciate
questions
know
99%
is
graded
by
exams
which
are
not
difficult
if
you
read
some
and
go
to
class
there
no
material
more
updated
than
late
1970s
other
how
outdated
usa
specific
her
knowledge
covers
well
basic
criminology
theories
categories
policy
options
-----
professor
dixon
is
clearly
well-versed
in
criminology
and
her
class
informative
interesting
at
times
coming
to
will
help
you
get
a
b
or
b+
but
must
do
all
of
the
readings
an
having
over
100
dense
pages
for
one
week
not
generally
possible
i've
never
known
anyone
who
does
just
most
-----
i
took
her
for
criminology
and
it
was
a
pretty
basic
class
the
whole
based
on
three
tests
solely
lectures
readings
don't
bother
buying
book
because
she
just
regurgitates
in
you
could
probably
get
b
without
doing
any
showing
up
to
or
vice
versa
very
smart
reputable
woman
-----
lisa
might
not
be
the
best
lecturer
but
she
is
super
nice
in
person
attendance
mandatory
and
posts
all
materials
that
will
help
you
study
curves
every
single
one
of
her
exams
too
many
quizzes
homework
a
decent
amount
just
read
textbook
do
practice
set
-----
the
course
uses
r
studio
and
code
if
you
go
to
her
office
hours
she
will
literally
type
it
in
got
perfect
grades
when
did
for
me
no
one
really
goes
hrs
so
is
more
willing
help
do
lab
webassign
quiz
due
every
wk
my
ta
was
worst
drops
two
of
lowest
-----
lisa
is
nice
knowledgeable
about
the
subject
and
often
available
for
office
hours
however
she
comes
off
as
inexperienced
in
teaching
has
trouble
with
engaging
class
during
lectures
sometimes
made
material
very
confusing;
people
walked
out
also
r
coding
program
left
confused
didn't
help
us
much
-----
prof
mckeen
is
quite
the
hard
grader
he
also
assigns
a
lot
of
essays
throughout
semester
10
2-page
3
4-page
try
to
avoid
this
class
if
writing
not
something
you
enjoy
-----
professor
mckeen
is
a
good
that
tries
to
make
the
material
somewhat
engaging
although
he
does
assign
lot
of
essays
throughout
semester
pretty
lenient
in
grading
them
-----
papers
do
not
have
set
due
dates
and
the
syllabus
in
general
does
a
great
structure
nice
professor
gives
good
feedback
10
response
get
tedious
you
need
to
plan
other
essays
ahead
of
time
since
they
are
at
end
semester

dr
coruzzi
is
really
passionate
about
plants
and
it
comes
through
in
her
lectures
lecture
pace
was
a
little
fast
but
the
slides
are
easily
accessible
cover
everything
you
need
to
know
for
exam
pob
ii
general
much
more
enjoyable
than
i
recommend
-----
her
lectures
were
fine
and
i
didn't
find
the
information
to
be
boring
even
though
i'm
not
usually
one
for
plant
biology
test
questions
are
straightforward
relatively
easy
mostly
coming
from
homework
which
was
really
make
sure
you
pay
attention
in
recitation
you'll
this
portion
of
course
-----
she
really
likes
plants
more
than
you
probably
good
teacher
but
definitely
need
to
think
deeply
about
it
because
her
organization
is
a
little
weird
and
make
your
own
connectins
-----
muni
is
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
had
at
nyu

extremely
knowledgeable
and
kind
she
makes
lectures
very
interesting
it
was
my
favorite
cams
class
as
long
you
participate
sometimes
make
an
effort
you'll
do
well
-----
this
course
was
by
far
the
best
i
have
taken
during
my
college
years
learned
so
much
professor
olia
is
smart
and
inspiring
want
to
be
her
class
very
likely
change
career
plans
in
future
but
think
it
could
helpful
for
any
student
at
nyu
as
truly
opens
your
eyes
world
-----
professor
olia

one
of
the

-----
jeff
day
where
do
i
begin
this
man
has
changed
everything
for
me
he
completely
made
rethink
the
way
photograph
and
view
world
cares
about
his
students
gives
constructive
feedback
anticipates
what
you
need
before
even
know
it
is
a
powerful
-----
what
i
love
about
jeff
is
he's
not
interested
in
helping
you
fill
a
requirement
towards
diploma;
actually
teaching
skills
that
can
use
the
real
world
and
grow
as
an
artist
get
back
put
into
class
so
to

a
lot
of
technical
knowledge
as
well
artistic
input
made
me
such
better
photographer

recommend
-----
prof

understanding
person
if
you
submit
something
late
once
or
have
trouble
with
an
assignment
but
she
will
call
out
in
class
you're
clearly
not
doing
what
asked
for
caring
who
wants
the
best
her
students
realizes
ask
lot
so
more
open
to
discussion
-----
she

willing
to
help
outside

the
extremely
interesting
not

i
took
her
intro
to
galleries
and
museums
of
new
york
class
she
is
a
fantastic
woman
it
was
mostly
field
trip
so
attendance
pretty
important
on
those
days
but
homework
minimal

reading
optional
as
long
you
show
genuine
interest
you'll
get
an

i
love
professor
choi
he
is
soooo
cute
and
nice
his
class
was
hard
but
you
can
definitely
get
your
grade
up
if
try
would
recommend
him
-----
really
funny
and
entertaining
class
genuinely
wants
students
to
succeed
he
has
a
lot
of
experience;
not
good
if
you
want
learn
bookkeeping
but
teaches
how
analyze
financial
statements
-----
professor
guth
is
older
so
it
can
be
very
hard
to
pay
attention
during
the
first
half
of
semester
while
he
lectures
nonstop
big
isp
project
killer
but
that
case
no
matter
what
was
extremely
nice
and
caring
all
his
students
those
readings
were
a
pain
-----
very
kind
and
funny
he
is
old
so
it's
hard
to
pay
attention
at
times
but
he's
a
fair
grader
seems
care
about
the
students
-----
great
teacher
learnt
so
much
she
is
very
motivating
i
love
her
style
totally
recommend
-----
you
will
learn
so
much
in
her
class
that
your
head
explode
the
lectures
are
awesome
but
she
pushes
to
do
great
work
may
be
stressed
out
during
semester
when
it's
all
over
twice
student
were
going
writing
improve
have
no
choice
was
outstanding
could
not
recommend
it
more
-----
alex
is
actually
a
really
great
teacher
and
an
easy
grader
the
midterm
pretty
difficult
but
he
grades
it
as
nicely
can
gives
less
quizzes
than
supposed
to
which
nice
he's
helpful
guy
lets
us
out
early
all
time
-----
made
this
just
to
warn
everyone
he
is
horrible
do
not
take
him
you
can't
understand
what
he's
talking
about
and
if
makes
a
mistake
justifies
it
by
say
oh
i'm
good
at
math
then
please
stop
teaching
class
his
awful
brought
my
gpa
down
tremendously
there
isn't
single
person
i've
found
who
likes
avoid
-----
i
took
the
8
week
course
he
offered
for
2
credits
and
it
was
well
worth
we
never
met
as
a
class
since
everything
performed
online
more
or
less
at
our
own
pace
assignments
were
easy
short
but
they
made
you
think
interact
with
knowledge
you'd
collected;
which
is
perfect
strongly
recommend
taking
him
-----
intro
to
media
could
not
figure
out
what
kind
of
expectations
he
had
for
his
students
took
off
points
slightest
reasons
after
reaching
and
meeting
him
numerous
times
discuss
topics&
my
work
i
got
no
real
help
there
was
way
get
a
good
grade
seemed
like
predisposed
who
thought
gave
me
chance
-----
i
went
to
lectures
however
never
actually
reviewed
any
of
my
notes
she
basically
just
out
the
textbook
if
your
read
and
by
mean
outline
pay
very
close
attention
detail
you
will
be
fine
her
office
hours
clarify
a
couple
concepts
is
helpful
-----
i'll
give
her
credit
for
this
being
first
year
lecturing
exam
questions
tend
to
be
very
difficult
and
unlike
those
she
asks
in
class
the
textbook
helps
understand
a
lot
of
concepts
homework
takes
long
time
do
still
doesnt
prepare
you
well
enough
exams
she's
really
funny
though
seems
nice
just
hard
-----
great
professor
has
many
degrees
or
something
like
that
tests
are
focused
on
what
she
says
during
lectures
textbook
is
unnecessary
except
for
the
dri
values
front
cover
assignments
and
stuff
-----
had
her
for
nutrition
&
health
she's
a
very
nice
woman
knows
stuff
and
engaging
during
class
minimal
amount
of
assignments
several
quizzes
2
midterms
final
exams
are
specific
make
sure
to
study
both
slides
text
hated
grading
no
curves;
what
you
get
is
rarely
chance
extra
credit
-----
professor
lee
is
an
extremely
knowledgable
musician
her
willingness
to
help
students
reflected
on
students'
performances
many
of
my
peers
and
i
had
never
taken
music
theory
classes
prior
this
class
by
the
end
feel
like
we
all
a
firm
grasp
basics
also
read
textbook
it
helps
-----
accent
is
tough
to
understand
at
times
but
yoon
ji
understands
and
cares
about
what
going
on
in
your
life
flexible
with
assignments
if
it
needed
-----
don't
take
her
class
-----
she
might
be
clear
about
what
wants
from
you
but
talking
to
her
is
really
stressful
and
depressing
regardless
of
talk
or
how
long
after
you'll
realize
that
she's
never
said
anything
positive
your
academic
performance
taking
class
having
in
regular
basis
was
such
as
pain
-----
he's
a
great
guy
with
really
extensive
knowledge
on
asian
history
soft-spoken
but
when
you
listen
to
what
he
says
it's
very
interesting
i
learned
lot
in
this
class
gives
good
and
helpful
feedback
the
assignments
-----
the
guy
is
so
humble;
he
apparently
very
multilingual
and
i
mean
has
had
a
long
history
in
field
but
you
won't
know
because
keeps
bar
up
professional
friendly
easy-going
professor
would
take
his
other
classes
future
-----
frank
is
a
very
insightful
man
and
great
teacher
i
enjoyed
his
class
race
ethnicity
popular
media
so
much
we
went
on
field
trips
talked
about
current
sexuality
issues
in
america
read
interesting
texts
really
had
discussions
take
-
he's
awesome
-----
frank
is
a
super
awesome
professor
he
easy
going
intelligent
and
eager
for
his
students
to
learn
you
will
only
get
feedback
in
the
middle
end
of
semester
but
can
email
him
see
how
are
doing
work
isn't
too
heavy
assigns
lot
reading
no
textbooks
books
articles
-----
he
is
the
best
-----
he
is
awesome
great
case
study
homework
easy
to
pass
-----
his
lectures
seem
to
go
on
for
ages
and
clarity
varies
from
lecture
he
clearly
knows
the
material
but
delivery
of
it
is
questionable
there
was
a
quiz
every
week
not
easy
too
difficult
he's
great
guy
professor
me
most
likely
will
take
class
with
him
again
-----
professor
trogdon
is
a
good
guy-
he's
readily
available
willing
to
help
and
clearly
knowledgeable
in
the
subject
however
his
exams
are
hard
averages
for
both
midterms
under
65
hw
nearly
impossible
without
internet
despite
this
he
gives
generous
curve
i
think
it
would
not
pass
but
very
difficult
do
well
-----
the
professor
speaks
with
indian
accent
which
at
times
make
it
difficult
to
comprehend
as
a
student
you
should
have
prior
knowledge
of
topic
being
taught
once
rapidly
goes
through
course
-work
he
will
expect
know
-----
he
seems
to
know
what
is
doing
very
well
but
having
a
hard
time
process
what's
in
his
brain
something
digestable
student
also
has
pretty
thick
indian
accent
i
didn't
mind
at
all
during
class
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
at
nyu
and
reason
why
i
stayed
in
my
major
she
is
so
sweet
humble
yet
has
much
experience
industry
both
as
an
artist
executive
definitely
take
her
class
will
make
you
love
music
publishing
-----
blakeman's
class
has
been
the
most
enjoyable
music
business
i've
had
she's
very
knowledgeable
about
industry
and
encourages
students
to
discuss
their
opinions
open-minded
actually
listens
suggestions
itself
is
pretty
easy;
there's
a
lot
of
group
projects
though
-----
very
different
teaching
method
unstructured
doesn't
lecture
and
likes
to
let
the
conversation
go
where
it
wants
can
be
frustrating
at
times
but
is
also
nice
able
talk
about
what
you
need
your
grade
comes
from
logs
write
her
end
of
each
class
not
anonymous
so
careful
a
final
paper
-----
professor
jo
is
very
knowledgeable
and
has
lots
of
clinical
experience
she
teaches
the
class
in
an
experiential
manner
as
opposed
to
boring
lectures
power
points
expects
everyone
participate
discussions
wants
do
well
lastly
gives
helpful
feedbacks
on
graded
papers
i
recommend
her

frank
is
a
phenomenal
teacher
if
you
are
passionate
and
show
that
care
you'll
have
no
problem
getting
an

difficult
but
do
take
time
make
sure
to
turn
them
in
on
because
of
this
motivated

get
excited
about
what
learning
-----
frank
is
an
amazing
teacher
and
very
helpful
if
you
have
any
problems
with
of
the
products
lateness
assignments
get
graded
on
a
lower

late
so
it's
definitely
in
your
best
interest
to
turn

time
good
grade

bob
is
a
wonderful
man
and
has
really
great
guests
speakers
for
entertainment
media
industries
one
thing
that
was
little
frustrating
though
no
matter
how
much
or
work
i
seemed
to
put
in
would
also
get
b
he
even
admitted
on
the
first
day
of
class
only
20%
should
a's
other
than
solid
prof
-----
great
teacher
and
person
i
liked
this
class
because
he
brings
so
much
useful
industry
perspective
to
the
course
rather
than
having
studied
material
he's
actually
done
a
lot
of
it
has
incredible
guest
speakers
all
readings
are
short
practical
workload
is
easily
manageable
he'll
remember
your
name
respect
effort
-----
had
high
hopes
for
the
nlp
class
overall
good
and
learned
a
lot
however
lectures
are
mostly
prof
copying
formulas
from
lecture
note
to
whiteboard
which
isn't
helpful
final
exam
was
ridiculously
difficult
only
neural
network
math
homeworks
were
bit
disorganized
too
is
very
busy
doesn't
seem
have
that
much
time
teach
anymore
-----
the
lecture
is
amazing
helps
you
really
understand
field
and
view
it
from
a
broad
perspective
-----

-----
i
really
enjoyed
having
professor
regaignon
she
is
very
friendly
and
always
responsive
especially
over
e-mail
it
can
be
difficult
to
vocalize
your
thoughts
in
english
classes
but
never
made
anyone's
comment
seem
unimportant
or
wrong
-----
professor

she'd
literally
give
you
100
words
quiz
on
them
the
next
day-
like
sparkling
orange
juice
if
take
plan
going
a
tutor
