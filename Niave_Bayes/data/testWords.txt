professor
barna
is
the
best
super
wise
and
hilarious
prof
barna
knows
a
lot
about
historical
cultures
his
class
is
an
attainable
a
if
you
just
fill
out
the
study
guide
for
the
finals
and
midterms
almost
no
hw
he
teaches
based
on
what
he
wants
us
to
know
rather
than
what
what
we
don't
know
if
that
makes
sense
rambles
sometimes
take
him
-----
professor
barna
if
anything
is
an
amazing
professor
although
he
does
tend
to
go
off
on
tangents
at
times
it's
not
a
bad
thing
to
me
his
tangents
make
his
lectures
more
interesting
more
entertaining
and
in
my
opinion
more
efficient
his
unique
and
distinct
perspective
on
the
books
we
read
only
further
the
previous
statement
take
his
class
-----
nyu
liberal
studies
is
a
huge
waste
of
money
and
professors
like
barna
prove
just
why
every
class
he
goes
off
on
random
tangents
talking
about
god
knows
what
then
when
it
hits
finals
and
midterms
he
decides
to
cram
all
the
info
that
he
shouldve
been
teaching
the
entire
time
barna
is
a
clown
professor
so
if
you
want
to
waste
tuition
hes
great
-----
john
barna's
class
is
an
absolute
joke
he
goes
off
topic
for
most
of
the
class
period
repeats
himself
every
single
lesson
and
fills
the
rest
of
his
class
period
with
useless
junk
do
yourself
a
favor
and
don't
waste
your
tuition
on
taking
this
man's
class
-----
professor
barna
is
a
funny
person
who
enjoys
talking
about
his
fencing
team
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
cf
and
want
to
get
a
good
grade
consider
taking
his
class
-----
do
yourself
a
favor
don't
take
professor
barna
it
is
a
solid
waste
of
your
tuition
he
only
cares
about
his
sports
teams
which
you
should
join
if
you
are
stuck
in
his
class
never
really
teaches
anything
and
his
tests
are
at
least
three
times
as
long
as
any
other
cf
test
literally
took
me
just
under
4
hours
-----
professor
barna
is
a
living
legend
legit
if
you
play
sports
and
join
his
intramural
team
you
are
guaranteed
an
a
i
don't
think
he
actually
grades
exams
papers
because
we
never
got
our
midterm
and
final
back+paper
and
for
those
who
don't
play
sport
just
fill
out
the
study
guide
because
that
is
the
exam
-----
do
not
take
if
you
don't
love
culture
things
and
these
books
he
has
extra
class
which
will
influence
your
grade
and
his
study
guide
is
horribly
tough
though
u
can
pass
exams
with
study
guide
-----
he's
caring
very
lenient
with
deadlines
he
gives
you
a
study
guide
for
the
exam
with
the
questions
related
to
the
exam
class
is
very
relaxed
you
don't
need
to
participate
and
he
talks
a
lot
you
don't
need
to
take
a
lot
of
notes
in
class
-----
great
professor
talks
a
lot
in
class
does
not
care
if
you
listen
or
not
one
of
the
best
in
nyu
-----
definitely
taking
barna
again
very
understanding
if
you
ever
needed
an
extension
or
missed
a
class
for
something
important
if
you
were
late
and
spoke
to
him
after
class
about
it
he'd
usually
just
mark
you
as
present
he
gave
study
guides
that
could
be
filled
out
and
used
on
midterm
final
which
were
very
easy
but
very
long
no
one
really
read
-----
barna
is
the
best
professor
at
nyu
easiest
a
and
a
great
class
to
catch
up
on
your
sleep
take
him
-----
barna's
a
legend
-
take
him
play
for
his
intramural
team
talk
to
him
about
sportsa
his
lectures
are
quite
useless
so
use
them
as
a
study
hall
midterm
and
finals
are
long
but
you
get
a
study
guide
-
and
nothing
else
comes
in
fact
u
can
even
meet
him
outside
class
and
he'll
help
u
fill
the
whole
study
guide
he's
the
easiest
professor
at
nyu
-----
barna
is
the
easiest
a
you'll
ever
recieve
sweet
guy
and
means
well
but
if
you
actually
want
to
learn
something
do
not
take
him
also
trying
to
stay
awake
during
his
lectures
proves
incredibly
difficult
-----
living
legend
show
up
to
class
fill
out
the
study
guides
that
you
get
to
use
on
the
exams
and
you
will
get
an
a
he's
the
easiest
teacher
at
nyu
-----
he
is
genuinely
very
kind
he
rambles
off
topic
a
lot;
read
and
teach
yourself
and
be
up
to
date
with
bookshe
is
very
lenient
on
work
i
turned
in
everything
on
the
last
day
of
class
literally
just
go
to
class
do
not
skip
and
just
talk
to
him
time
to
time
and
you
will
probably
get
an
a-
if
you
discuss
in
class
literally
anything
he'll
love
you
-----
he
is
truly
an
old
fashioned
professor
if
you
take
him
prepare
to
have
2
very
long
midterms
but
he
gives
you
them
beforehand
and
lets
you
take
them
with
the
test
definitely
do
not
wait
to
the
last
night
to
fill
them
out
and
you
will
be
more
than
ok
i
love
jb
and
if
you
can
manage
your
time
you
will
as
well
-----
i
thought
i
would
be
able
to
sit
through
his
long
boring
useless
and
off-topic
lectures
all
semester
for
the
easy
a
but
i
was
terribly
mistaken
i
did
not
learn
a
single
useful
thing
and
to
top
it
off
he
expects
you
to
attend
extra
classes
outside
of
the
normal
class
schedule
at
the
end
of
the
year
because
of
his
disorganization
-----
professor
barna
is
a
nice
guy
who
is
passionate
about
classic
literature
his
lectures
can
get
so
far
off
topic
however
that
sometimes
it
feels
as
though
he's
really
rushing
through
material
he
spent
the
first
two
classes
of
the
semester
telling
us
how
different
he
is
from
every
other
professor
at
nyu
which
is
what
every
professor
thinks
-----
such
a
nice
guy
very
clear
on
his
expectations
and
a
fair
grader
he
is
always
willing
to
help
and
will
make
sure
you
understand
all
material
before
a
midterm
or
final
interesting
lectures
and
great
professor
overall
highly
recommended
-----
a
legend
one
of
my
favorite
professors
at
nyu
so
far
i
took
him
for
sf1
and
for
sf2
&
may
take
him
again
for
sf3
unfortunately
he
did
have
health
problems
last
semester
but
that
is
out
of
his
control
&
i
managed
to
get
a
good
grade
anyway
i
think
you
really
only
need
to
do
the
reading
&
work
hard
on
the
essays
and
you
will
be
fine
-----
there
is
essentially
no
clear
grading
criteria
so
unless
you
know
the
way
he
grades
get
ready
to
be
screwed
over
he
is
a
nice
guy
but
will
not
compromise
on
anything
during
our
class
he
was
out
for
almost
half
the
semester
due
to
health
problems
which
is
out
of
his
control
of
course
but
he
expected
us
to
do
all
of
the
work
without
teaching
-----
portanova
is
a
quirky
nice
professor
who
makes
for
an
enjoyable
class
he
sometimes
goes
on
tangents
but
always
makes
sure
the
material
needed
is
taught
the
readings
can
be
a
bit
heavy
but
if
you
participate
or
ask
a
q
once
every
class
you
will
be
fine
midterms
and
finals
are
easy
as
long
as
you
paid
attention
ask
him
about
his
dachshund
-----
portanova
is
a
great
professor
he
is
very
lecture
heavy
and
yes
will
go
on
tangents
but
it's
obvious
that
it's
because
he's
passionate
about
what
he's
teaching
he's
very
accessible
outside
of
class
and
he
gives
great
feedback
during
office
hours
just
make
a
point
to
comment
ask
questions
during
class
because
he
does
grade
on
participation
-----
portanova
can
be
a
great
guy
but
most
of
his
lectures
were
irrelevant
and
he
would
often
go
off
on
tangents
wanted
students
to
participate
for
a
grade
but
never
opened
the
class
for
discussions
and
whenever
students
did
participate
he
would
talk
down
to
them
to
prove
he
had
more
knowledge
on
the
subject
-----
do
the
reading
if
you
do
the
very
clearly
listed
readings
and
take
okay
notes
than
you're
solid
for
his
class
because
he
pretty
much
goes
over
the
readings
in
more
detail
for
sf1
there
are
2
essays
pretty
easy
midterm
and
final
he
lectures
mostly
but
adds
humor
ever
so
often
it's
not
that
hard
to
do
well
in
his
class
-----
it
was
hard
to
keep
up
with
his
course
but
he
is
a
great
person
-----
portanova
is
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
had
at
nyu
you
definitely
have
to
do
the
readings
before
class
but
it
makes
the
lectures
engaging
he
also
picks
really
interesting
literature
for
the
class
that
covers
more
than
just
white
european
authors
his
exams
are
straightforward
but
he's
a
tough
grader
on
papers
-
but
office
hours
are
helpful
-----
you
have
to
put
the
time
into
this
class
do
the
readings
take
notes
listen
well
in
lectures
portanova
is
a
fantastic
lecturer
-
so
much
knowledge
to
share
and
fun
stories
thrown
in
for
effect
it's
a
hard
class
but
it's
rewarding
when
you
put
in
the
effort
lots
of
reading
and
he
expects
you
to
participate
in
speaking
to
it
in
class
-----
professor
portanova
is
incredibly
intelligent
and
knowledgable
his
lectures
are
very
interesting
and
he
has
a
sweet
quirky
sense
of
humor
he
is
always
at
least
10
mins
late
but
he
gives
very
straightforward
and
interesting
reading
and
paper
assignments
ask
him
about
his
dachshund
-----
joseph
is
my
favorite
teacher
at
nyu
his
lectures
are
hysterical
and
incredibly
interesting
make
sure
to
go
to
class
because
he
bases
his
exams
on
content
of
class
discussions
but
they're
really
not
hard
if
you
do
the
reviews
his
office
hours
also
helped
in
the
two
papers
he
assigns
and
he's
a
very
fair
grader
all
in
all
a
phenomenal
human
-----
he
knows
literally
everything
about
the
material
very
knowledgable
but
his
reading
expectations
are
wild
he
never
cancels
class
but
he
will
likely
be
about
10-20
minutes
late
every
single
day
midterms
finals
aren't
hard
only
3
questions
so
really
only
need
to
thoroughly
study
2
texts
for
each
exam
don't
waste
your
time
studying
everything
-----
honestly
i
was
surprised
by
the
class
quality
based
on
these
comments
boring
lectures
talks
over
you
always
late
completely
arbitrary
grading
system
that
he
almost
refused
to
explain
sweet
guy
but
not
a
great
professor
-----
showed
up
late
to
class
7
out
of
10
times
and
would
start
class
15
minutes
late
he
grades
for
participation
but
doesn't
ask
a
lot
of
questions
tried
to
participate
and
he
spoke
over
me
goes
on
tangents
a
lot
can't
be
sure
what
to
write
down
-----
i
took
him
for
both
sfi
and
sfii
and
it
was
a
blast
he
is
knowledgeable
and
loves
participation
if
you
do
the
readings
and
listen
to
the
lectures
you
will
do
fine
he
expects
a
lot
in
essays
but
the
exams
are
definitely
doable
he's
hilarious
and
just
an
adorable
human
being
10
10
would
take
again
i
wanted
to
but
his
classes
fill
up
so
quickly
-----
my
friend
and
i
used
to
refer
to
him
as
king
joseph
the
reasonable
if
he
gives
you
a
bad
grade
it's
totally
fair
and
he
doesn't
expect
anything
insane
from
you
in
order
to
get
an
a
he
can
be
surprisingly
funny
and
charming
and
his
map-making
skills
are
insane
super
memorable
-----
great
professor
signed
swifty
morgan
-----
i
love
portanova
he
expects
a
certain
amount
of
dedication
and
effort
from
his
students
but
altogether
he's
not
a
particularly
hard
grader
read
the
assigned
hw
and
you'll
do
just
fine
in
class
and
probably
on
the
midterm
final
too
his
lectures
were
interesting
the
man
is
so
knowledgeable
and
he
told
fun
stories
in
them
also
field
trips
-----
portanova
really
cares
about
the
material
he
teaches
very
prepared
for
class
and
there
a
wide
variety
of
materials
used:
literature
poetry
art
photography
film--you
name
it
he
makes
the
class
exciting
with
his
jokes
and
whiteboard
drawings
also
very
engaging
helpful
during
office
hours
excellent
professor
assignments
are
interesting
too
-----
professor
portanova
is
really
knowledgeable
and
passionate
about
the
areas
he
teaches
but
he
can
be
unclear
on
grading
criteria
definitely
do
the
assigned
readings
there's
a
lot
and
answer
the
discussion
questions
before
class
really
helps
you
understand
the
material
better
-----
terrible
professor
with
even
worse
grading
the
course
allows
for
no
improvement
even
if
there's
a
drastic
change
in
writing
extremely
boring
lectures
with
some
expecting
you
to
read
a
whole
book
in
between
classes
worst
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
-----
incredibly
boring
lectures
complete
with
zero
student
interaction
and
unclear
grading
uses
very
obscure
grading
scale
nearly
all
of
the
midterm
and
final
was
definitions
seems
very
kind
but
is
ruthless
when
it
comes
to
grading
i
would
definitely
recommend
that
you
at
all
costs
do
not
take
this
class
your
choice
-
choose
wisely
-----
horribly
monotonous
and
boring--no
clear
grading
criteria
whatsoever
an
extremely
closed-minded
professor
who
will
branch
off
into
pop
culture
tangents
constantly
and
expects
you
to
memorize
passages
and
lengthy
definitions
verbatim
for
the
midterm
final
would
rather
switch
majors
than
take
this
class
again
-----
her
grading
expectations
are
unclear
for
the
midterms
and
finals
you
better
memorize
everything
to
the
t
or
it's
over
for
you
:
not
very
open-minded
to
other
ways
of
thinking
but
her
own
worst
professor
i
have
ever
had
would
not
recommend
taking
i
only
took
her
because
no
one
else
was
available
good
luck
you'll
need
it
:
-----
her
midterm
did
not
make
sense
and
she
would
take
points
off
for
things
if
you
did
not
do
it
exactly
as
she
wanted
not
open
to
different
ideas
and
ways
of
thinking
other
than
her
own
her
examples
of
good
writing
are
subpar
if
you
use
class
notes
she
tells
you
not
to
penalizes
you
but
then
its
like
why
am
i
coming
to
class
then
-----
she
clearly
cares
about
the
subject
which
is
the
only
positive
i
saw
with
her
i
never
do
reviews
on
this
but
she
was
so
bad
i
felt
i
had
an
obligation
she
expects
yuo
to
follow
her
guidelines
for
writing
essays
deviate
in
the
slightest
and
you
earn
yourself
an
f
this
would
sound
fine
if
her
guidelines
weren't
ridiculous
-----
pamela
brown
is
a
very
disengaging
professor
not
only
does
she
lecture
in
a
monotonous
tone
but
her
expectations
are
also
ridiculous
she
holds
a
very
high
standard
for
your
assignments
and
if
you
deviate
slightly
from
her
guidelines
you
will
be
marked
down
-----
horrible
teacher
every
class
is
identical
she
gets
in
front
of
the
class
and
just
reads
the
book
i
didn't
learn
anything
in
this
class
and
was
constantly
frustrated
with
how
much
of
a
waste
a
time
the
class
was
also
she
grades
on
whether
she
likes
you
or
not
on
her
midterm
and
final
you
are
required
to
memorize
word
for
word
paragraphs
-----
ridiculous
you
will
put
the
most
effort
into
this
class
to
get
the
worst
grade
-----
number
one
piece
of
advice
for
this
class
is
to
ask
for
help
she's
super
happy
to
tell
you
what
she
wants
and
will
let
you
know
if
you're
on
the
right
track
her
desired
writing
style
is
hard
to
get
used
to
and
she
can
be
a
tough
grader
but
if
you
try
hard
you
will
do
pretty
well
her
lectures
are
info
heavy
and
very
interesting
-----
tests
are
based
on
very
specific
parts
of
the
lecture
make
sure
to
study
definitions
ahead
of
time
-----
i
struggled
to
stay
awake
every
single
class
and
i
wasn't
the
only
one
students
barely
understood
what
she
was
teaching
the
work
wasn't
too
bad
if
you
pay
attention
but
that's
the
hard
part
didn't
understand
that
we
aren't
advanced
philosophy
students
if
you
are
you'll
do
well
and
were
just
taking
this
because
it
was
required
-----
prof
brown
was
the
best
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
she
really
cares
about
her
students
and
is
very
helpful
in
everything
her
lectures
are
amazing
and
she
is
very
knowledgeable
when
compared
to
the
other
profs
i've
taken
who
just
waste
time
in
class
doing
meaningless
discussions
she
actually
teaches
a
lot
take
her
if
you
actually
want
to
learn
-----
professor
brown
is
one
of
the
most
boring
professors
i've
had
so
far
her
lectures
drag
on
also
the
topics
for
her
essays
are
insanely
intricate
and
require
you
to
read
the
prompt
at
least
15
times
to
even
get
some
kind
of
understanding
on
what
its
asking
that
being
said
her
exams
are
easy
she
gives
you
pretty
much
the
entire
test
beforehand
-----
worst
prof
i've
ever
had
-----
a
very
intelligent
professor
but
has
no
room
for
others'
opinions
which
makes
her
appear
stuck
up
and
condescending
the
material
is
fairly
easy
but
prof
brown
manages
to
complicate
it
deliberately
and
makes
students
believe
that
the
class
is
hard
and
their
low
grades
are
fair
an
acceptable
professor
but
doesn't
suit
nyu
at
all
-----
professor
brown
is
amazing
she's
tough
but
that
really
motivated
me
to
do
my
best
in
her
class
i
can
say
that
of
all
my
professors
this
semester
i
got
the
most
out
of
her
she
really
wants
the
best
for
her
students
especially
when
it
comes
to
writing
definitely
not
a
class
you
can
easily
bs
an
a
is
doable
but
it
will
take
hard
work
-----
literally
the
worst
professor
i've
ever
had
she
is
entirely
uninspirational
and
boring
get
ready
to
literally
memorize
entire
paragraphs
and
write
the
dullest
most
obvious
essays
possible
i
love
reading
and
writing
and
even
for
me
she
made
every
book
completely
tiresome
do
not
take
her
please
she
will
ruin
good
literature
for
you
-----
she
is
an
extremely
tough
grader
and
her
expectations
of
good
writing
were
very
hard
for
me
to
understand
and
carry
out
in
my
essays
she
is
pretty
arrogant
when
she
talks
to
you
and
is
very
firm
in
her
own
beliefs
and
is
not
open
to
other
beliefs
weekly
blogs
count
towards
participation
absolutely
avoid
her
if
you
want
an
easy
class
-----
she
is
a
very
intelligent
woman
who
knows
her
stuff
and
succeeds
in
making
everything
clear
for
students
to
understand
but
she
is
one
of
the
harshest
graders
i've
ever
had
20
verbatim
paragraph-long
definitions
required
for
midterm
and
final
and
only
worth
15%
of
the
whole
test
kills
us
on
grading
essays
her
idea
of
good
writing
is
ridiculou
-----
prof
tucker
is
the
best
he
is
an
amazing
lecturer
and
he
is
clearly
very
excited
and
passionate
about
politics
he
gives
an
outline
of
every
lecture
in
advance
so
you
know
what
key
topics
will
be
touched
on
i
cannot
stress
enough
how
great
he
is
your
grade
is
really
up
to
the
tas
but
they
were
great
and
graded
objectively
-----
go
to
lectures
there
is
no
textbook
so
what
he
says
in
class
constitutes
most
of
the
exams
his
lectures
are
well-organized
and
super
informational
that
little
time
for
questions
and
chats
is
allowed
though
he
is
not
that
accessible
outside
class
i'm
fortunate
that
i
met
a
great
ta
reading
isn't
strictly
required
if
your
goal
is
to
pass
-----
excellent
lecturer
one
of
the
best
at
nyu
course
well-organized
never
any
surprises
tucker
always
explains
objectives
&
structure
of
each
lesson
is
clear
&
direct
attendance
not
taken
but
you
should
go
unless
you
plan
to
teach
urself
through
very
dense
readings
highly
recommend
for
pol
majors
needing
to
fulfill
core
start
here
or
pol-ua300
-----
i
absolutely
love
professor
tucker
he
basically
covers
the
material
in
the
readings
during
class
so
the
readings
are
more
to
further
your
understanding
i
don't
think
it's
a
lot
of
reading
it's
manageable
he's
an
amazing
lecturer
makes
everything
very
clear
and
he's
clearly
passionate
and
knowledgeable
definitely
recommend
taking
his
class
-----
incredible
and
likable
professor
who
gives
very
engaging
lectures
there
is
a
lot
of
reading
which
can
help
further
your
knowledge
in
the
course
but
its
not
necessarily
necessary
to
do
well
in
the
class
as
long
as
you
take
great
lecture
notes
and
have
a
good
recitation
love
the
class
highly
recommend
-----
i
love
him
he's
a
passionate
respected
acclaimed
handsome
genius
and
the
best
lecturer
only
reason
to
not
take
him
is
if
you
hate
learning
superfluous
amounts
of
reading
but
not
impossible
with
good
time
management
&
they
align
with
lectures
attend
listen
to
lecture
since
he
only
speaks
writes
advanced
material
but
not
a
hard
course
-----
overall
great
professor
with
engaging
lecture
the
readings
are
painful
sometimes
and
ignore
them
if
you
have
to
since
they
are
only
worth
a
few
marks
on
the
tests
focus
on
attend
all
lectures
ask
questions
in
recitations
and
make
comprehensive
study
guides
for
tests
you
will
do
great
-----
way
too
many
readings
and
they're
all
heavily
important
but
not
explicitly
discussed
and
dissected
he
seems
uncomfortable
teaching
in
front
of
a
classroom
and
has
illegible
handwriting
his
notes
often
are
one
worded
and
more
dependent
on
the
verbal
content
a
lot
of
information
no
concise
outline
or
takeaways
for
each
topic
-----
his
lectures
are
amazing
and
the
amount
of
reading
has
been
reduced
honestly
you
don't
have
to
do
the
readings
but
you
do
have
to
go
to
lecture
because
he
breaks
down
all
the
concepts
really
well
learned
a
lot
grading
is
entirely
dependent
on
your
tas
and
i
find
the
grading
to
be
pretty
harsh
but
i
still
think
the
class
is
worth
it
-----
very
very
very
good
professor
lectures
are
really
good
-
he's
super
knowledge
and
funny
too
-
horrible
handwriting
tho
just
go
to
lecture
+
recitation
and
a
bit
of
studying
and
you'll
be
fine
-----
tough
grader
i
had
the
worst
ta
which
really
ruined
my
experience
-----
the
class
is
reading
intensive;
tons
of
readings
each
week
and
are
responsible
for
in
both
recitation
and
the
exams
and
paper
the
tas
determine
your
grade
understand
what
they
look
for
to
get
an
a
my
grade
dropped
from
an
a
to
a
b+
because
of
just
one
essay
answer
on
the
final
the
ta
did
not
like
on
the
final
take
the
class
with
caution
-----
a
really
great
class
and
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
had
class
is
difficult
with
a
lot
of
reading
and
a
large
focus
on
eastern
europe
taught
like
a
second
year
course
with
high
expectations
and
tough
grading
do
most
to
all
of
the
required
reading
and
attend
lecture
to
do
well
-----
professor
tucker
is
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
ever
had
you
listen
to
the
lectures
and
do
some
supplemental
reading
and
you
will
get
an
a
by
far
the
most
interesting
politics
class
i've
taken
highly
recommend
-----
i
love
josh
he's
amazing
and
cares
so
much
about
what
he
does
he
grades
hard
but
he
really
cares
and
is
available
if
you
need
help
his
lectures
are
engaging
and
amazing
recitation
sucks
but
what
can
you
do
-----
spoke
way
too
quickly
and
often
confused
the
class
by
repeating
the
same
thing
so
many
times--not
as
if
he
wanted
to
give
us
different
ways
of
understanding
a
concept
but
as
if
he
hadn't
prepared
the
best
way
to
articulate
his
thoughts
before
the
lecture
always
5-10
minutes
late
but
the
first
10
lectures
were
great
and
grading
was
very
fair
-----
jt
was
an
excellent
lecturer
makes
complicated
topics
more
simple
he
is
very
helpful
outside
of
class
as
well
there
is
however
a
lot
of
reading
make
sure
to
go
to
the
lecture
most
of
the
material
if
not
all
is
important
for
the
final
i
personally
did
not
do
a
single
reading
they
were
way
too
long
wordy
etc
but
did
pretty
ok
-----
this
man
is
so
interesting
i
could
listen
to
him
talk
all
day
but
in
the
end
the
workload
was
too
much
for
me
so
i
had
to
drop
the
class
i'd
say
it
would
be
a
great
class
to
take
pass
fail
but
there
is
a
lot
of
work
involved
he
is
very
unapologetic
about
the
amount
of
work
but
he's
a
great
professor
-----
yes
he
is
a
very
smart
professor
simplifies
the
readings
well
but
too
much
readings
to
the
point
it
is
not
doable
also
it
is
very
easy
to
get
a
b
but
not
an
a
to
get
an
a
you
have
to
be
extremely
close
with
your
ta
because
they
have
so
much
power
over
your
grades
one
thing
con
is
that
professor
is
not
a
very
active
part
in
giving
grades
-----
he
is
honestly
one
of
the
best
professors
ive
had
his
lectures
are
very
engaging
and
interesting
he
is
very
clear
in
terms
of
grading
criteria
if
you
do
the
readings
and
study
for
the
exam
it
is
not
a
hard
class
he's
very
helpful
and
approachable
-----
this
course
needs
no
homework
no
tests
all
you
need
to
do
to
receive
an
easy
a
is
to
write
a
good
30-page
journal
about
your
experience
during
the
semester
i
need
to
say
a
lot
of
students
dislike
ollman
just
because
they
do
not
understand
the
lecture
believe
me
listen
to
his
lectures
carefully
and
read
some
of
his
books
you'll
love
him
-----
great
intro
to
socialism
if
it's
something
ur
interested
in
ppl
get
offended
when
he
doesn't
take
their
very
tired
criticisms
seriously
but
don't
get
that
he's
studied
the
stuff
for
60
years
n
ur
a
college
freshman
don't
worry
about
missing
lectures
too
much
just
make
up
with
readings
work
on
your
journal
weekly
and
you'll
ace
great
funny
guy
-----
his
lecturers
are
unorganized
the
class
had
no
syllabus
you
have
to
get
10
books
but
he
doesnt
give
clear
directions
on
when
to
read
them
the
whole
class
is
based
on
a
journal
where
you
basically
have
to
pretend
to
be
a
marxist
in
order
to
get
an
a
if
you
show
you
put
effort
into
your
journal
you'll
probably
get
an
a
he's
all
about
ur
opinions
-----
i
honestly
don't
think
ollman
grades
based
on
political
belief
at
all
my
journal
was
probably
more
leaning
on
the
conservative
side
than
most
but
i
still
ended
up
with
an
a
you
just
have
to
be
clear
with
your
arguments
and
not
procrastinate
until
the
very
last
few
days
to
do
this
20-30
page
journal
really
interesting
guy
-----
the
negative
review
on
here
sort
of
make
me
sad
i
mean
i
definitely
get
the
criticisms
people
have
of
him
but
personally
i
really
enjoyed
his
class
he's
this
delightful
socialist
dude
who's
really
accommodating
to
student
issues
his
lectures
are
definitely
hard
to
follow
though
but
they
are
still
very
interesting
-----
professor
ollman
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
professors
that
i've
had
at
nyu
i
believe
his
books
are
rather
well
read
in
the
world
of
marxist
or
dialectical
works
the
main
coursework
are
from
his
books
which
really
analyzes
marx's
concepts
and
connects
them
to
current
events
in
class
do
the
readings
and
work
on
the
journal
weekly
:
-----
absolutely
horrible
professor
just
do
not
take
him
if
you
want
a
meaningful
experience
-----
worst
professor
i
have
ever
had
repeated
the
same
vague
statements
every
class;
would
forget
what
readings
he
assigned;
doesn't
engage
students
or
learn
students'
names
avoid
even
if
you
are
incredibly
interested
in
marxism
as
i
am
since
most
of
the
reading
is
just
ollman's
theory--a
quack
elliptical
pseudo-philosophy
a
disgrace
to
the
dept
-----
this
was
an
amazing
class
if
you
do
the
readings
he
puts
on
his
syllabus
you
can
write
a
great
journal
to
get
an
a
dont
be
shy
to
reach
out
for
help
if
you
are
confused
about
your
grade
he'll
be
happy
to
meet
with
you
and
discuss
and
potentially
amend
it
life
changing
opened
my
eyes
to
the
horrors
of
capitalist
society
who
is
john
galt
-----
i'm
very
interested
in
marxist
theory
and
i
was
having
trouble
staying
awake
during
lectures
i
don't
think
he
plans
class
at
all
just
walks
in
and
talks
for
an
hour
don't
bother
asking
him
a
question
or
attempting
to
disagree
with
him
he'll
flat
out
ignore
you
very
disappointed
-----
as
a
poly
student
course
was
convenient
in
satisfying
humanities
requirement
not
writing
intensive
only
a
30-50
pg
journal
about
your
thoughts
reactions
and
summaries
of
lectures
due
at
the
end
of
the
semester
gives
you
the
freedom
to
choose
to
either
begin
writing
journal
at
the
beginning
of
semester
or
later
on
easy
a
course
alright
prof
-----
people
are
too
harsh
on
him
good
course;
the
only
assignment
is
a
journal
which
everybody
puts
off
until
the
last
minute
come
in
with
an
open
mind
show
up
to
every
lecture
do
the
readings
and
you'll
learn
a
lot
it
also
would
have
been
nice
if
he
would
tie
the
material
to
current
events
and
real
life
-
it
would
have
been
more
cool
like
that
-----
this
guy
man
he
was
an
awful
teacher
easy
class
if
you
don't
want
to
do
anything
and
procrastinate
till
the
very
end
-----
i'm
very
interested
in
socialist
marxist
theory
but
i
wish
he
took
a
more
modern
approach
on
it
he
did
not
encourage
discussion
at
all
and
whenever
someone
would
ask
a
question
about
what
he
was
saying
he
often
dismissed
them
i
can
tell
he's
knowledgeable
but
some
of
what
he
says
seems
very
60s
and
his
lectures
are
hard
to
pay
attention
to
-----
lectures
are
repetitive
and
i
find
myself
not
going
to
class
often
because
he
often
says
the
same
things
no
tests
or
essays
whatsoever
just
a
40
pg
journal
due
at
the
end
of
the
semester
and
he
wants
you
to
read
4
books
on
socialism
doesn't
believe
in
grades
hard-core
marxist
take
this
course
super
easy
a
and
the
material
is
interesting
-----
i
took
him
for
socialist
theory
i'm
interested
in
the
subject
but
didn't
find
him
to
be
a
great
lecturer
the
books
he
published
were
clearer
than
his
lectures
which
helped
with
the
40
page
journal
due
at
the
end
of
the
course
the
only
assignment
-----
professor
ollman
is
1
of
a
kind
if
you
do
not
get
distracted
easily
and
can
focus
100%
without
drifting
for
75min
you
will
be
fine
if
you
listen
to
lecture
from
start
to
finish
you
will
learn
more
than
from
most
other
professors
grade
is
based
off
a
40
page
journal
you
can
disagree
with
him
and
still
get
an
a
i
did
but
had
to
be
thorough
-----
i
would
not
recommend
this
class
because
the
entire
grade
is
a
40
page
journal
that
details
your
journey
through
socialism
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
rubric
and
no
way
to
check
your
progress
so
you
don't
have
any
clue
what
your
grade
will
be
he
hates
grades
and
it
shows
-----
terrible
-----
one
of
the
biggest
morons
i
had
in
college
he
basically
blackmailed
the
class
into
engaging
in
extra-curricular
activities
that
were
important
to
him
and
his
socialist
buddies
by
threatening
to
not
give
everyone
an
a
frequently
late
and
never
prepared
lectured
if
you
can
call
it
that
by
the
seat
of
his
pants
a
real
jackass
-----
be
ready
to
teach
yourself
homework
require
you
to
do
work
based
on
the
chapter
that
is
covered
in
the
lecture
after
the
due
date
which
makes
it
kind
of
pointless
to
go
to
class
but
that
forces
you
to
read
the
book
which
helps
with
understanding
the
material
well

easy
second
midterm
repeats
questions
from
first
one
-----
if
you
are
a
cs
major
student
you
should
definitely
take
his
class
his
lectures
are
super
interesting
and
inspiring
so
that
you
won't
be
distracted
by
other
things
be
prepared
to
work
hard
for
midterms
and
final
cuz
it
is
not
easy
to
predict
what
he
would
test
you
but
if
you
done
your
readings
and
pay
attention
to
his
lectures
you
will
be
fine
-----
as
the
negative
comments
have
revealedif
you
are
taking
cs
just
because
everyone
is
taking
it
don't
take
bloomberg
you
have
to
be
really
engaged
to
be
successful
but
it
doesn't
shed
from
the
fact
that
he
is
a
fantastic
professor
capable
to
make
the
material
interesting
he
will
let
you
to
make
up
for
your
mistake
if
you
work
hard
-----
thorough
textbook
reading
is
a
must
in
order
to
do
well
on
the
exams
homeworks
are
graded
rather
leniently
some
will
push
you
to
the
tutor
center
tests
are
not
that
bad
30
multiple
choice
and
2
code
writing
exercises
repeats
mc
questions
sometimes
not
a
bad
class
bloomberg
makes
you
work
for
the
grade
-----
amos
is
overall
very
solid
pros:
grading
is
decently
weighted
on
the
hw
which
is
easy
and
he
will
curve
exams
cons:
exams
are
tricky
-
only
30
important
multiple
choice
questions
lectures
are
often
slow
you
need
to
take
notes
in
lecture
-
obscure
things
he
mentions
are
on
tests
it's
not
difficult
at
all
to
get
an
a-
with
moderate
effort
-----
bloomberg's
class
is
pure
torture
he
talks
about
random
stuff
and
his
ability
to
teach
is
close
to
zero
he
is
unable
to
keep
students
attention
and
listening
to
him
is
an
experience
from
hell
unfortunately
i
couldn't
say
that
i
learned
or
understood
a
single
thing
in
his
lectures
he
makes
a
dry
subject
feel
like
the
sahara
stay
away
from
him
-----
mixed
feelings
about
this
class
lectures
are
boring
but
you
have
to
pay
attention
because
the
exams
are
really
tough
a
big
portion
of
your
grade
will
be
homework
which
is
relatively
easy
but
the
exams
are
seriously
tough
readings
not
necessary
for
class
but
i
would
suggest
studying
them
for
midterm
and
final
-----
made
me
decide
to
no
longer
be
a
computer
science
major
his
practice
tests
do
not
prepare
you
for
the
exam
i
would
recommend
taking
a
different
professor
if
possible
-----
amos
is
overall
a
very
solid
professor
pros:
grading
is
heavily
weighted
on

cons:

boring
it's

at

to

-----
amos
is
a
solid
choice
for
intro
to
web
design
the
lectures
can
sometimes
be
a
little
dry
but
he
spices
things
up
with
sarcastic
jokes
the
projects
are
super
easy
to
get
100
on
the
tests
are
more
difficult
class
average
for
the

was
70%
if
you
attend
lectures
on
a
regular
basis
you
can
get
at
least
a

with
minimal
effort
-----
the
tests
in
this
class
can
be
a
little
tougher
but
overall
the
course
is
not
hard
amos
is
a
good
lecturer
and
teaches
things
quite
well
with
good
in
class
examples
his
tests
are
weird
because
you
have
more
than
1
answer
and
you
have
to
circle
all
the
correct
answers
to
get
the
question
right
so
beware
you
will
learn
though
so
take
him
-----
he
is
a
great
professor
who
has
a
good
pace
in
class
and
gives
easy
exams
-----
a
brilliant
professor
he
taught
the
content
very
well
had
a
good
pace
with
material
very
responsive
with
questions
-----
excellent
professor
who
is
dedicated
to
pedagogy
and
driven
by
a
genuine
joy
of
computer
science
although
the
coursework
can
be
burdensome
he
is
an
incredibly
fair
grader
and
will
help
students
who
show
initiative
an
a
is
totally
achievable
if
you
put
in
the
work
generous
with
extra
credit
textbook
is
hugely
helpful
-----
a
very
helpful
and
informative
professor
although
he
didn't
seem
like
it
at
first
hard
to
reach
him
by
email
which
gave
the
impression
that
he
didn't
want
to
talk
to
students
but
it
turns
out
he's
actually
rather
helpful
and
approachable
in
person
do
the
homework
yourself
and
really
understand
the
concepts
because
the
exams
are
difficult
-----
his
lectures
are
kind
of
dull
but
they
can
be
helpful
if
you
pay
attention
he
loves
taking
questions
so
that's
good
just
go
to
him
if
you
have
questions
the
tests
seem
hard
at
first
and
then
if
you
get
the
essentials
of
the
python
the
tests
will
become
so
much
easier
he
can
be
a
nice
choice
and
cs
is
interesting
-----
hes
a
solid
choice
very
clear
and
thorough
and
available
outside
class
however
his
exams
are
very
long
and
often
dont
test
the
material
in
a
way
thats
considered
and
effective
this
leads
students
who
lose
focus
after
a
while
to
do
worse
in
his
exams
if
youre
reading
this
amos
and
i
bet
u
are
test
concepts
that
dont
require
much
writing
-----
professor
bloomberg
gives
a
very
informative
presentation
of
the
course
material
and
clear
instructions
his
handsome
look
and
great
personality
make
it
very
hard
to
skip
even
one
lecture
it
was
also
a
great
time
chatting
with
him
during
office
hours
exams
are
reasonable
and
he
replaces
lower
early
exam
scores
with
the
later
ones
-----
avoid
this
professor
at
all
costs
-----
very
caring
and
kind
you
learn
mostly
by
doing
your
homework
he's
always
willing
to
help
and
wants
you
to
know
the
material
his
tests
are
kind
of
weird
some
of
his
exam
questions
are
structured
ambiguously
and
he
doesn't
give
partial
credit
making
it
fairly
difficult
to
get
100
overall
good
professor
-----
professor
tharoor
takes
forever
to
grade
and
provide
feedback
on
your
work
not
only
that
it
seems
like
she
doesnt
read
emails
and
just
says
whatever
is
on
her
mind
based
on
the
way
you
look
overall
she
is
not
nyu
level
-----
soothing
voice
sometimes
wanna
sleep
in
class
lots
of
reading
but
can
get
away
w
not
doing
all
of
it
heavy
class-discussions
and
abt
90%
of
what
she
mentions
in
lecture
is
exactly
on
the
exam
no
trick
questions
at
all
but
oddly
specific
at
times
her
papers
allow
for
a
lot
of
creativity
and
she's
a
decently
easy
grader
had
her
cf1
as
well
-----
so
terrible
i
can
not
warn
enough
people
against
this
professor
please
do
not
take
her
she
takes
about
a
month
to
grade
the
smallest
things
but
then
assigns
hours
worth
of
homework
every
night
we
are
supposed
to
get
final
grades
72
hours
after
the
final
but
here
i
am
almost
two
weeks
after
the
final
without
a
grade
so
boring
and
so
terrible
-----
absolute
worst
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
don't
take
this
professor
been
almost
two
weeks
since
the
final
and
still
haven't
gotten
a
grade
yet
expects
us
to
do
extreme
amounts
of
work
but
then
doesn't
actually
do
any
grading
for
the
class
minu
makes
me
so
angry
and
she
is
literally
the
worst
teacher
i've
ever
had
-----
worst
professor
i've
had
so
far
at
nyu
lectures
are
extremely
boring
and
there
is
always
at
least
one
person
dozing
off
of
already
asleep
during
each
class
she
assigns
multiple
videos
and
readings
every
night
and
sends
out
massive
emails
that
are
too
overwhelming
to
read
took
her
over
a
month
to
grade
a
short
paper
would
not
take
again
-----
awful
she
has
preferences
between
students
her
classes
are
boring
gives
too
many
readings
-----
very
hard
to
follow
her
and
she
expects
a
lot
from
you
with
reading
it's
not
a
hard
class
but
its
confusing
and
you
can't
follow
her
lectures
so
that
makes
it
hard
there
are
so
many
amazing
other
teachers
at
nyu
there's
no
reason
to
take
a
mediocre
teacher
-----
she's
a
nice
lady
but
her
class
drag
on
gives
way
too
much
homework-
multiple
half
hour
videos
and
chapters
to
read
per
night
it's
overwhelming
and
boring
focuses
a
lot
on
architecture
and
art
from
the
middle
east
-----
she
gives
way
too
much
readings
she
grades
pretty
easy
but
the
lectures
were
just
so
boring
she's
you're
average
college
professor
put
in
no
effort
easy
b+
put
in
some
effort
you'll
get
an
a-
you
gotta
work
really
hard
for
an
a
though
-----
she
is
a
very
sweet
lady
and
very
passionate
about
what
she
teaches
assigns
a
lot
of
readings
before
class
however
you
don't
really
have
to
do
it
to
understand
what
she
teaches
pretty
easy
grader
if
you
take
notes
in
class
and
include
that
in
your
essays
overall
pretty
good
would
definitely
take
her
again
-----
super
sweet
&
super
caring
but
she
assigns
a
lot
of
homework
and
reading
in
preparation
for
class
she's
very
passionate
and
makes
lectures
interesting
though
-----
mrs
tharoor
doesn't
make
an
entertaining
class
the
papers
aren't
given
back
with
good
feedback
and
she
grades
them
very
specifically
she
doesn't
lay
out
what
exactly
she
wants
with
papers
or
the
final
i
took
her
and
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
again
-----
when
i
say
she's
a
tough
grader
i
mean
that
she's
subjectively
tough
style
in
your
papers
is
punished
-
eg
if
you
reference
an
aphorism
adage
or
make
anything
close
to
resembling
an
assertive
argument
you'll
be
penalized
treat
the
essays
as
an
ap
literature
prompt
and
you'll
probably
be
pretty
well
off
don't
take
risks
with
writing
-----
such
a
great
teacher
the
reviews
dont
do
her
justice
she
is
very
passionate
enthusiastic
knowledgeable
and
kind
she's
constantly
asking
if
the
workload
is
manageable
participation
is
necessary
seeing
as
her
class
is
discussion
based
but
it
doesnt
feel
overwhelming
so
far
1
essay
3
pages
long
1
exam
super
easy
and
1
final
essay
-----
great
class
if
you
don't
like
to
participate
then
her
classes
aren't
for
you
very
helpful
with
giving
feedback
on
essay
drafts
exams
are
straightforward
and
easy
enough
if
you
study
she's
so
nice
and
makes
the
subject
so
enjoyable
to
learn
not
a
class
you
can
coast
though
put
in
the
work
and
you'll
be
fine
-----
i
really
loved
having
professor
tharoor
the
whole
class
if
pretty
easy
if
you
are
interested
in
the
topic
and
do
the
readings
for
homework
she
loves
opinions
and
discussions
and
never
tells
anyone
they
are
wrong
the
papers
are
easy
to
write
but
she
gives
a
lot
of
feedback
and
is
a
tough
grader
use
her
comments
to
guide
the
next
paper
-----
super
passionate
about
the
material
and
inspires
you
to
appreciate
the
texts
and
art
not
a
lot
of
work
primarily
a
mid-term
final
and
a
paper
she'll
call
on
you
to
participate
because
she
genuinely
wants
to
talk
about
the
text
great
feedback
on
papers
and
very
smart
woman
take
her
look
her
up
she
has
huge
connections
in
india
-----
the
exams
are
unnecessarily
specific
if
you
don't
ingest
caffeine
you
will
not
stay
awake
in
this
class
i
seriously
hate
all
gls
classes
specifically
cultural
foundations
-----
i
still
see
her
in
my
dreams
-----
nice
person
but
her
grading
is
very
harsh
-----
this
class
was
unnecessarily
hard
because
of
him
it
was
basically
american
government
101
but
because
he
rushed
through
1000
concepts
it
made
it
difficult
midterm
wasn't
that
bad
final
was
hard
because
he
asked
unnecessarily
specific
questions
when
he
didn't
go
that
in-depth
to
the
concepts
made
me
rethink
my
politics
major
avoid
at
all
costs
-----
some
classes
were
very
interesting
overall
good
choice
out
of
the
fore
core
politics
reqs
would
take
after
international
politics
because
game
theory
is
tested
on
but
he
doesn't
spend
much
time
teaching
it
assuming
most
of
us
have
taken
a
class
on
it
readings
are
interesting
and
manageable
not
really
necessary
to
do
the
textbook
ones
-----
gordon
is
a
decent
professor
lectures
range
between
extremely
interesting
to
mediocre
midterm
was
25%
game
theory
despite
never
teaching
it
i
got
lucky
because
my
friends
had
taken
game
theory
before
and
taught
me
random
2
question
quizzes
are
given
almost
every
other
class
midterm
was
easy
other
than
the
game
theory
quirky
guy
-----
sg
tells
you
to
study
your
notes
from
the
lectures
for
the
exam
meanwhile
the
midterm
is
based
solely
on
the
supplemental
readings
and
game
theory
he
flys
through
the
one
class
on
gt
yet
it's
worth
25%
on
your
exam
wtf
dude
would
not
advise
missing
lecture
because
there
are
random
pop
quizzes
which
are
difficult
and
are
10%
of
your
grade
-----
gordon
taught
my
lecture
for
power
and
politics
in
america
not
an
easy
class
but
it
was
fairly
interesting
full
of
game
theory
so
beware
gives
pop
quizzes
occasionally
but
they're
multiple
choice
you
def
have
to
pay
attention
and
write
down
what
he
says
not
what's
on
the
board
does
not
allow
pics
of
slides
or
laptops
not
great
to
meet
with
-----
tries
too
hard
to
be
funny
organized
lectures
but
the
content
can
get
pretty
confusing
and
muddled;
course
is
heavy
on
game
theory
hope
for
a
good
ta
helpfulness
wise
review
sessions
are
hit-or-miss
depending
on
the
people
who
ask

and
the
tas
-----
lectures
somewhat
interesting
exams
are
tough
but
grading
is
fair
if
you
want
to
get
an
a
go
to
the
lectures
takes
good
notes
and
read
all
of
the
blackboard&
kollman
reader
assignments
dont
bother
with
lgsa
unless
youre
confused
you
learn
alot
very
thorough
class
if
you
pay
attention
&try
you
will
easily
get
an
a
and
find
it
very
useful
-----
though
the
exams
are
somewhat
tough
if
you
do
the
readings
and
study
the
outline
that
he
gives
you
before
the
exams
you
will
do
well
the
class
is
exteremly
interesting
and
you
will
really
learn
the
ins
and
outs
of
american
politics
-----
he
is
a
mess
granted
his
lectures
are
often
entertaining;
however
what
he
presents
in
class
does
not
reflect
the
exams
the
examples
he
uses
in
class
are
straighforward
the
questions
on
the
exam
are
not
he
expects
you
to
think
quickly
on
your
feet--a
quality
that
not
many
undergrads
posess
please
avoid
at
all
costs
-----
clear
and
fascinating
lectures
a
reasonable
amount
of
reading
which
is
largely
interesting
tests
and
papers
that
are
challenging
but
doable
-----
he
reminded
me
of
stephen
colbert
his
lectures
always
seemed
very
straightforward
and
so
did
the
textbook
but
the
blackboard
readings
were
hell
however
the
exams
had
challenging
multiple
choice
and
i
had
no
idea
where
the
questions
came
from
the
answers
were
like:
none
of
the
above
a
&
b
b
&
c
very
frustrating
easy
grading
on
paper
-----
his
class
was
not
that
bad
just
pay
attention
to
the
lectures
he
was
nice
enough
to
post
an
outline
of
every
lecture
at
the
end
of
the
semester
and
with
explanations
of
the
game
theory
he
did
make
the
lectures
fun
and
interesting
and
the
tas
were
pretty
easy
on
grading
and
gave
you
all
the
answers
if
you
asked
them
for
help
later
-----
this
has
to
be
the
worst
politics
class
i
have
taken
the
exams
were
difficult:
he
gave
you
straightforward
information
in
class
and
then
expected
you
to
have
an
epihany
on
the
test
when
he
threw
in
game
theory
that
you
have
never
seen
in
your
life
the
multiple
choice
was
tricky
and
looked
like:
a
b
c
a&b
b&c
ab&c
all
of
the
above
come
on
-----
exams
were
tough
each
exam
was
30-40%
multiple
choice
the
point
of
which
seemed
to
be
to
trick
you
rather
than
to
test
comprehension
the
game
theory
was
equally
difficult
as
there
was
always
an
additional
element
to
the
models
that
had
not
been
reviewed
in
class
that
we
were
supposed
to
reason
out
during
the
exam
he's
also
fairly
arrogant
-----
this
class
was
a
mess
the
tests
came
out
of
no
where
there
is
no
reason
why
multiple
choice
should
be
difficult
the
game
theory
on
the
exam
is
completely
different
from
what
he
shows
you
in
class
the
exams
will
make
you
want
to
crap
yourself
he
does
not
communicate
with
the
tas
because
they
had
no
idea
what
the
exams
were
going
to
be
like
-----
excellent
clear
and
often
witty
lectures
grade
based
entirely
on
exams
which
are
not
to
difficult
if
you
go
to
lecture
and
read
for
the
course
-----
professor
gordon
always
starts
class
with
something
to
get
our
attentionhe's
pretty
square
with
glasses
and
sportcoats
but
then
he's
like
yo
wassup
he
keeps
the
class
exciting--the
powerpoints
are
dry
but
he
makes
them
interesting
and
he
challenges
you
by
including
exam
questions
from
the
slides
he's
cool
-----
one
of
the
cool
teachers
who
makes
class
enjoyable
just
study
his
lectures
and
you'll
be
fine
-----
he
is
the
best
professor
i've
had
amazing
his
lectures
are
great
perfect
balance
b
w
textbook
outside
reading
info
on
slides
and
him
talking
perfect
very
straightforward
exams
attendance
not
mandatory
but
if
you
go
to
lectures
you'll
do
a
lot
better
on
the
exams
and
he
makes
it
interesting
so
you
want
to
go
take
his
class
-----
great
professor
always
well
spoken
and
has
a
great
sense
of
humor
definitely
take
his
classes
-----
if
you
take
this
class
for
core
be
ready
to
study
very
minute
and
irrelevant
information
he
emphasizes
concepts
and
understanding
theories
yet
wants
you
to
memorize
a
very
specific
details
one
of
the
questions
asked
if
you
like
fish
you
may
enjoy
this
transitional
creature
it
was
the
tiktaalik
not
an
easy
a
expect
to
study
hard
-----
i
never
really
write
reviews
but
i
feel
like
i
have
to
write
something
for
this
if
you're
considering
taking
this
class
be
prepared
to
jot
notes
about
every
single
detail
he
says
in
class
because
the
midterms
and
final
are
based
100%
off
trivial
facts
that
are
mentioned
ie
name
the
species
that
we
talked
about
no
concepts
memorization
based
-----
i
loved
professor
volk
he's
a
sweet
hippie
who
really
loves
what
he
teaches
exams
were
difficult
because
it
was
a
lot
of
memorization
but
i
still
enjoyed
the
class
and
his
enthusiasm
-----
just
make
sure
you
read
the
material
and
ask
questions
where
you're
confused
there
is
an
emphasis
on
knowing
facts
so
if
you
don't
understand
the
material
this
could
be
the
hardest
part
of
the
class
-----
i
has
volk
for
state
and
fate
of
the
earth
for
jterm
in
sydney
and
i
loved
his
class
so
much
it
was
extremely
interesting
and
he's
such
a
cool
guy
the
only
text
book
we
used
was
his
and
it's
very
interestingly
written
kind
of
reads
like
a
story
book
he
allows
so
much
freedom
for
your
final
project
too
take
this
class
-----
do
not
take
this
class
lectures
are
boring
and
he
writes
a
few
random
words
on
a
paper
that
is
projected
to
the
class
both
midterms
and
finals
are
on
that
and
it
makes
no
sense
makes
the
exams
unnecessarily
hard
with
confusing
questions
and
then
doesn't
curve
the
class
don't
buy
the
textbooks
its
useless
hated
this
class
ruined
my
gpa
-----
professor
volk
is
an
excellent
professor
he's
very
passionate
about
what
he
teaches
so
that
makes
his
lectures
interesting
especially
during
organism
moments
that
said
his
lectures
are
sometimes
slow
but
if
you
go
to
lecture
and
go
over
your
notes
before
the
exam
it's
easy
to
get
an
a
-----
do
not
take
this
class
his
lectures
are
incoherent
and
he
sprawls
random
words
down
on
the
projector
then
bases
the
exams
entirely
on
them
it's
about
memorizing
not
learning
labs
are
boring
do
not
recommend
-----
definitely
recommend
this
class
for
easy
a
you
have
to
go
to
every
lecture
though
because
the
tests
are
based
on
lecture
notes
before
an
exam
carefully
read
notes
handouts
and
previous
exams
skim
the
book
and
you're
all
set
you
don't
have
to
memorize
stuff
in
the
book
unless
he
covered
it
labs
are
extremely
boring
and
easy
-----
awful
do
not
take
him
test
are
insanely
detailed
lectures
are
boring
minus
those
few
beautiful
minutes
known
as
the
organism
moments
labs
aren't
that
bad
but
his
tests
are
enough
to
convince
me
that
his
class
is
just
not
worth
taking
oh
and
one
more
thing
you
need
3
different
textbooks
for
this
class
not
cool
do
not
take
this
class
-----
the
course
placed
much
more
emphasis
on
rogue
memorization
of
details
rather
than
actual
understanding
of
the
material
--
i
disapprove
-----
i
hate
to
contradict
the
consensus
opinion
on
here
but
i've
regretted
taking
a
class
with
volk
for
an
entire
semester
volk
evaluates
details
not
lessons
as
the
map
program
is
designed
to
test
class
is
highly
unstructured
boring
and
his
use
of
illegible
slides
is
frustrating
and
unacceptable
nice
guy
terribly
designed
class
-----
class
somewhat
interesting
although
that's
just
being
nice
tests
pretty
hard
if
you
do
moderately
well
on
exams
re-read
his
notes
extremely
carefully
&
text
book
i
believe
i
remember
he
pulled
random
information
from
there
too
and
do
very
well
in
the
lab
not
too
hard
you'll
be
fine
yet
again
easier
said
than
done
nice
professor
btw
-----
tyler's
a
very
approachable
professor
but
yes
there
are
a
lot
of
details
especially
concerning
co2
what
else
would
you
expect
from
someone
so
passionate
about
the
environment
his
exams
are
indeed
quite
bafflinghard
to
tell
whether
you
did
well
or
not
his
assignments
are
interesting
not
like
homework
overall
he's
a
fair
grader
-----
lectures
came
mostly
from
the
books
but
it
was
more
enjoyable
to
go
to
class
we
showed
organism
moment
videos
about
random
intereing
animals
tests
from
previous
years
were
available
online
and
provided
a
good
idea
of
what
to
study
the
labs
were
boring
and
very
high-school
like
but
incredibly
easy
also
he
is
very
likable
and
good-looking
-----
dorky
and
lovable
keeps
class
interesting
you
have
to
go
to
lecture
though
because
his
exams
are
surprisingly
difficult
and
he
fills
them
with
random
details
he
only
mentioned
in
passing
during
class
so
pay
attention
and
take
good
notes
pretty
good
nat
sci
ii
course
-----
professor
volk
is
an
amazing
teacher
who
keeps
his
class
extremely
interested
in
the
cirruculum
he
cares
deeply
about
what
he's
teaching
and
it
shows
the
tests
are
extremely
easy
questions
such
as
what
is
the
name
of
our
textbook
and
he
always
posts
a
test
from
the
previous
year
to
study
from
online
a
week
before
the
test
amazing
teacher
-----
this
class
is
extremely
boring
and
impossible
tons
of
details
covered
and
you
must
remember
every
single
detail
if
you
want
to
get
a
good
grade
nearly
impossible
especially
since
the
subject
matter
is
so
boring
and
irrelevant
and
volk
fails
to
make
any
of
it
interesting
despite
his
personal
fascination
with
it
all
do
not
take
this
class
-----
this
class
is
a
huge
joke
volk
is
a
good
guy
and
makes
the
horribly
boring
material
semi-interesting
however
come
test
time
he
mkaes
the
tests
very
difficult
expects
you
to
be
a
genius
if
you
dont
do
the
readings
you
are
screwed
-----
i
took
environmental
systems
science
with
him
he
explained
the
material
well
in
class
but
as
long
as
you
did
the
reading
from
the
textbook
the
tests
were
very
easy
--
especially
if
you
are
familiar
with
physics
or
chemistry
you
don't
have
to
go
to
class
usually
--
all
the
material
is
in
the
book
-----
i
took
her
for
cf1
and
cf2
so
caring
she
wants
her
students
to
do
well
participate
in
class
she
will
love
you
and
your
class
if
you
just
show
you
are
putting
in
the
effort
go
to
her
office
hours
and
she
will
guide
you
in
the
right
direction
for
written
assignments
love
her
love
her
class
can't
say
enough
great
things
about
her
-----
professor
newman
cares
it
is
very
evident
that
she
wants
her
students
to
do
well
and
she
genuinely
enjoys
being
around
her
students
to
do
well
in
class
participate
meet
with
her
about
papers
spark
up
conversations
with
her
and
you'll
do
well
however
i
was
incredibly
bored
in
this
class
i
hated
going
to
class
pick
a
different
professor
-----
she
is
fine
but
sorta
boring
+rambles
and
sometimes
a
hard
marker
-----
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
i
thought
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
by
taking
prof
newman;
but
it
turned
out
to
be
just
the
opposite
she
is
really
funny
and
although
she
can
come
off
as
being
a
hard-ass
she
is
kind
and
appreciates
people
who
do
the
reading
and
participate
in
class
-----
generally
in
both
cf
and
sf
all
you
have
to
do
is
read
and
you're
usually
good
newman
is
a
great
teacher
really
cares
lectures
are
fun
and
if
you're
confused
about
something
you
can
ask
her
not
that
hard
to
follow
her
in
class
it
can
be
entertaining
but
sometimes
boring
but
overall
great
teacher

roberta
is
an
amazing
lady
she's
such
an
intelligent
human
being
and
extremely
passionate
when
she's
teaching
her
students
you'll
definitely
leave
her
class
feeling
like
you've
learned
so
much
you
must
go
to
her
class
she
loves
students
who
participate
and
question
the
material
they're
reading
do
the
readings
and
put
effort
into
your
papers
-----
this
was
the
only
bad
teacher
i
had
at
nyu
sure
newman
knows
a
lot
about
baseball
but
grading
papers
arbitrarily
based
on
whether
or
not
you
like
someone
on
a
personal
level
is
juvenile
also
she
loves
making
off-color
quips
nonstop
she
gave
me
a
c-
on
the
final
paper
and
called
it
a
disaster
i
had
another
professor
grade
it
and
he
said
a-

she
is
the
best

the

engage
in

you'll
be

class
lectures
are
frustratingly
random
but
tries
to
keep
the
class
interesting
very
helpful
if
you
go
in
for

hours
and
takes
an
interest
in
her

no

will
have

they're
not

rough
-----
really
enthusiastic
professor
who
genuinely
cares
about
your
learning
she
gives
out
drafts
and
if
you
are
really
struggling
she
will
do
her
best
to
try
to
help
she
is
a
really
eccentric
character
which
makes

more
fun

she's
crazy
in
an
amazing
way
she's
always
willing
to
help
you
too
send
her

fun

difficult
grader
-----
although
she
is
a
tough
but
fair
paper
grader
prof
newman
gives
chances
to
bring
grades
up
through
rewrites
she
also
does
students
a
favor
by
putting
such
a
heavy
emphasis
on
class
participation
which
can
bring
up
your
grade
quite
a
bit
as
long
as
you
read
and
participate
you
will
definitely
like
this
class

although
she
is
a
tough
grader
on
papers
prof
newman
gives
plenty
of
chances
to
bring
those
grades
up
through
rewrites
she
also
helps
you
out
by
giving
class
participation
a
heavy
influence
on
your
grade
so
do
the
reading
and
most
importantly
talk
and
you
will
like
this
class
-----
anyone
who
complains
about
newman
is
obviously
stuck
in
high
school
she
is
the
epitome
of
an
amazing
college
professor
yes
she's
a
tough
grader
sometimes
but
she
gets
you
to
grow
up
and
realize
that
tests
aren't
matching
or
multiple
choice
and
essays
actually
have
to
make
sense
funny
and
sweet
go
to
her
for
extra
help
very
brilliant
-----
tough
grader
when
it
comes
to
papers
participation
counts
-----
so
i
had
her
for
gsp
social
foundations
and
while
i
liked
her
i
hated
the
class
and
felt
her
grading
was
difficult
i
also
had
her
for
a
topics
course
and
as
a
topics
teacher
she
is
amazing
though
participation=
way
better
grade
very
smart
woman
and
really
interesting
projects
were
fun
and
best
of
all
there
were
no
tests
-----
avoid
this
professor
at
all
costs
she
is
dreadful
and
completely
full
of
her
'brooklyn'
self
ridiculously
hard
grader
who
will
allot
a's
and
c's
not
on
the
content
and
quality
of
essays
but
whether
or
not
you
are
one
of
her
favorites
take
any
other
topics
class
this
is
by
far
the
worst
professor
in
the
gsp
staff
and
the
worst
i've
had
at
nyu
-----
she
was
unorganized
she
changed
the
syllabus
many
times
throughout
the
semester
her
grading
doesn't
make
sense
when
you
do
the
exact
opposite
of
what
she
says
she'll
give
you
an

phelps
is
a
great
choice
for
psych
101
her
lectures
are
very
entertaining
and
engaging
reading
the
book
definitely
helps
but
taking
good
notes
in
her
lectures
and
giving
minimal
attention
in
recitations
got
me
a
solid
grade
she's
pretty
clear
on
what
will
be
on
the
test
and
her
lectures
are
online
for
easy
studying
-----
phelps
was
such
a
great
professor
for
being
in
a
class
with
180+
students
she
was
clear
with
explaining
and
giving
good
examples
and
she
let
you
know
what
to
study
for
the
tests
and
final
which
was
a
big
help
tas
always
held
2
study
sessions
before
tests
too
-
big

options
for

to

-----
dr
phelps
is
an
awesome
professor
for
intro
to
psych
this
course
covers
so
much
information
and
she
comes
at
it
in
a
really
organized
way
she
posts
all
the
slides
and
shows
a
lot
of
video
clips
sometimes
she
just
reads
off
the
slides
but
overall
her
lectures
and
interesting
and
engaging
the
tests
cover
a
lot
but
are
fair
-----
interesting
lectures
clearly
passionate
about
her
work
very
important
to
go
to
lectures
as
videos
from
class
are
often
questions
on
tests
textbook
helps
as
well
-----
amazing
lectures
respected
really
knows
the
material
she
can
be
a
bit
intimidating
at
first
because
of
how
respected
accomplished
she
is
but
her
personality
is
very
chill
and
she
is
always
open
to
answering
questions
however
grading
sucks

great
professor
really
interesting
i
didn't
notice
until
i
actually
read
the
textbook
which
you
really
should
do
but
she's
cited
mentioned
in
the
textbook
numerous
times
just
goes
to
show
that
she
knows
her
stuff
if
you
didn't
already
figure
that
out
from
her
great
lectures
-----
easy
class
if
you
go
to
lecture
and
read
the
book
she's
passionate
about
the
subject
and
is
very
clear
what
she's
looking
for
in
the
exams
she
basically
tells
you
what
to
study
no
reason
to
not
get
an
a
if
you
actually
put
in
the
work
-----
this
was
one
of
the
easiest
classes
i
have
taken
yeah
it's
gonna
be
tough
if
you
don't
read
the
textbook
and
go
to
lecture
but
if
you
do
those
things
and
keep
up
with
the
reading
it's
really
easy
to
get
an
a
not
a
ridiculous
amount
of
reading
either
she
makes
the
class
really
interesting
and
is
clear
about
what
she's
looking
for
in
her
tests
-----
she
makes
lectures
interesting
but
the
tests
are
difficult
-----
prof
phelps
is
knowledgeable
and
the
nicest
person
you'll
ever
meet
however
the
grading
for
the
class
sucks
based
only
3
4
exams
and
a
paper
tas
are
horrible
with
the
exception
of
liz
they're
awful
at
grading
exams
thankfully
recitation
isn't
mandatory
can
easily
get
an
a
even
if
you
skip
class
but
make
sure
you
memorize
the
textbook
-----
test
graders
are
really
randomly
specific
and
nitpicky
so
know
the
exact
textbook
definitions
of
things
phelps
is
great
though
go
to
lecture
because
the
anecdotes
really
help
you
remember
the
material
-----
absolutely
brilliant
professor
explains
things
very
clearly
and
tells
funny
stories
that
break
up
the
material
and
help
you
remember
it
as
well
tests
are
tough
so
don't
skip
lecture
overall
a
great
class
and
the
reason
i
am
now
a
psych
major
-----
great
class
take
phelps
for
intro
to
psych
she's
the
bomb
the
lecture
notes
are
good
enough
and
the
lectures
are
clear
so
that
you
can
understand
easily
sometimes
graders
are
stupid
but
if
you
try
you
can
get
an
a
-----
thinks
u
r
dumb
and
treats
u
like
u
don't
want
to
learn
and
treats
the
material
like
it's
boring
-----
i
highly
recommend
this
class
professor
phelps
is
knowledgeable
and
passionate
about
psych
information
is
conveyed
clearly
during
lectures
she's
not
always
available
for
office
hours
because
the
class
is
so
large
but
tas
help
with
specific
questions
-----
she's
great
incredibly
intelligent
woman
really
quirky
and
relatable
makes
the
information
interesting
and
tells
hilarious
anecdotes
tests
are
really
manageable
if
you
attend
lecture
not
really
necessary
to
read
the
book
i'd
definitely
recommend
her
to
anyone
interested
in
psychology
-----
excellent
prof
is
close
in
lecture
to
book
material
if
you
attend
lecture
and
read
the
book
it's
very
possible
to
get
an
a
-----
although
i
disagree
with
the
people
below
i
find
that
phelps
was
a
great
professor
nonetheless
her
exams
were
manageable
but
the
test
graders
were
absolutely
ruthless
making
it
hard
to
get
a
solid
a
i
did
pull
off
a
b+
by
attending
all
her
lectures
and
reading
the
textbook
i
really
enjoyed
the
class
and
phelps
is
purely
amazing
:
-----
she's
an
awesome
teacher
really
knows
her
stuff
and
is
able
to
communicate
it
to
the
class
very
well
personally
i
dedicated
the
most
time
to
this
class
especially
with
reading
the
book
but
it
was
worth
it
as
long
as
you
read
the
chapters
and
review
her
slides
getting
an
a
is
not
hard
-----
liz
herself
is
great
and
gives
really
interesting
lectures
beware
those
of
you
looking
to
use
this
for
an
easy
a
gen
ed
test
graders
can
be
ruthless
i'm
not
a
psych
major
i'm
in
arts
and
i
found
the
tests
didn't
test
whether
i
actually
knew
the
material
but
if
i
memorized
it
in
the
book's
terms
-----
yoav
seemed
very
unprepared
during
class
he
had
an
attitude
whenever
students
asked
questions
because
he
skips
too
many
key
points
about
using
the
tools
-----
the
course
structure
is
open
ended
a
lot
of
creative
space
is
given
to
explore
new
ideas
for
group
projects
tools
taught
are
widely
used
in
the
industry
and
through
this
course
you
get
a
good
idea
of
real
world
practical
software
engineering
-----
i
really
love
this
course
and
this
professor
pro:
1
i
learnt
a
lot
of
open
technologies
and
angularjs
framework;
2
yoav
is
always
there
to
help
and
keeps
guiding
you
to
polish
your
game;
3
one
more
great
project
on
resume
con:
1
you
should
expect
extra
time
to
finish
homework
especially
when
you
are
still
not
familiar
with
the
framework;
-----
yoav
stubbornly
refused
helping
me
and
other
students
when
we
had
problems
he
refused
to
acknowledge
he
was
making
us
use
tools
that
did
not
work
as
he
described
he
never
tried
doing
the
assignments
himself
to
make
sure
they
were
possible
he
deserves
0s
-----
personally
i
feel
that
yoav
expects
too
much
from
us
we
have
to
learn
and
use
something
new
pretty
much
every
week
in
the
project
that
wouldn't
be
a
problem
except
his
explanations
in
class
usually
don't
suffice
and
you
end
up
being
confused
when
you
try
to
do
it
yourself
all
in
all
you
do
learn
a
lot
if
you
don't
slack
in
the
class
though
-----
i
would
not
recommend
taking
this
class
if
you
are
using
a
laptop
all
the
weird
plugins
and
tools
needed
slow
your
computer
to
a
crawl
every
time
you
need
to
debug
the
gwt
eclipse
tool
is
buggy
and
had
to
spend
most
of
my
week
trying
to
fix
it
it
left
no
time
to
actually
do
the
assignments
-----

many

thanks
for
teaching
outdated
tools
which
google
themselves
are
abandoning
-----
this
is
a
course
needing
extra
time
but
this
is
a
a
very
good
thing
for
me
if
you
study
hard
you
really
will
learn
a
lot
prof
zibin
is
very
responsible
for
answering
students'
questions
on
mailing
list
which
are
much
more
than
on
other
course's
mailing
list
-----
made
an
ok
game
during
class
really
basic
but
better
than
most
other
students
unfortunately
no
game
companies
cared
since
it
relied
only
on
google
services
i
should
have
looked
at
their
job
listings
and
taught
myself
tools
the
industry
actually
uses
instead
of
googles
rusty
framework

it
was
the
class
mailing
list
it
will
give
you
a
real
account
of
the

there
was
a
total
of
815
emails
sent
to
the
list
not
including
the
svn
messages
815
emails~58
a
week
i
got
a
0
grade
homework
because
yoav
assigned
it
after
class
in
an
email
and
it
needed
to
be
checked
in
before
the
next
class
-----
class
was
surprisingly
dry
considering
the
subject
it
seemed
like
yoav
didnt
take
it
seriously
and
the
students
suffered
he
was
frequently
unprepared
for
class
and
often
stopped
halfway
through
because
he
ran
out
of
material
or
lost
internet
and
couldnt
google
what
he
was
suppose
to
know
-----
yoav
zibin
knew
the
basics
of
the
weird
tools
were
required
to
use
but
could
not
solve
many
of
the
problems
students
faced
with
their
projects
it
took
a
lot
of
effort
to
get
past
all
the
negative
feelings
for
game
programming
i
developed
from
this
class
and
finally
start
enjoying
it
again
as
they
say
it
gets
better
-----
most
of
the
class
is
setting
up
obscure
google
tools:
gwt
mgwt
gwt-phonegap
gwt-internationalization
gwt-mockito
gwt-facebook
google
app
engine
and
gae-channel
gae-datastore
the
remaining
3
lectures
git
unit
testing
and
game
ranking
are
somewhat
useful
and
are
actually
used
in
the
industry
-----
project-oriented
a
lot
of
popular
technologies
angularjs
gae
rest
api
oauth
phonegap
small
part
of
them
involved
group
project
using
git
only
java
is
prerequisite
a
really
helpful
course
-----
professor
did
not
give
clear
guidance
on
how
to
do
the
homework
it
was
very
difficult
finding
any
resources
on
the
subject
since
the
tools
he
taught
are
not
popular
in
the
industry
id
recommend
students
to
look
at
gaming
startups
in
the
city
and
teach
themselves
the
tools
they
are
using
skip
this
class
if
you
can
-----
please
be
advised
yoav
assigned
extra
homework
on
the
mailing
list
a
lot
of
the
class
missed
the
email
and
were
harshly
penalized
using
his
grading
policy
also
note
the
class
website
and
syllabus
are
not
written
in
stone
expect
them
to
change
for
the
worst
like
the
did
for
my
semester
-----
i
wish
the
professor
was
more
approachable
but
he
ran
out
after
every
class
every
time
i
emailed
him
a
question
he
just
repeated
the
question
back
without
answering
it
in
general
i
got
the
impression
he
only
knows
the
tools
on
the
surface
and
did
not
actually
know
how
things
worked
under
the
hood
-----
professor
was
extremely
approachable
and
quick
to
respond
both
online
and
offline
i
enjoyed
the
group
project
portion
of
the
course
which
is
very
much
like
a
professional
situation
although
the
curriculum
is
centered
around
gaming
i
learned
a
lot
about
server
side
processing
persistence
security
and
other
things
that
apply
to
any
web
app
-----
this
course
is
interesting
and
need
some
independent
studythis
is
a
course
which
is
very
close
to
real
life
work
i
got
a
high
paying
job
in
a
company
developing
browser
games
because
of
this
project
experience
-----
beware
you
only
have
the
first
2
classes
obviously
the
easiest
classes
to
decide
if
your
going
to
stay
in
class
or
drop
it
with
a
refund
make
sure
you
are
aware
the
deadlines
i
waited
too
long
to
drop
out
and
wish
wish
i
hadnt
it
just
kept
spiralling
worst
and
worst
as
the
semester
progressed
-----
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
class
but
the
expectations
were
unclear
from
the
first
lecture
the
walks
varied
by
which
ta
or
professor
was
giving
them
it
was
so
hard
to
know
what
to
study
this
could
be
a
great
class
if
the
logistics
and
expectations
were
made
more
apparent
i'm
not
a
humanities
major
and
some
people
had
the
time
of
their
lives
-----
took
the
architecture
core
class
and
absolutely
loved
it
it's
a
dense
once
a
week
class
but
very
interesting
and
changed
the
way
i
look
at
nyc
she
says
it
a
million
times
but
you
really
do
need
to
go
to
class
and
take
notes
there
are
a
few
papers
easy
a's
and
a
midterm
and
a
final
-----
mosette
is
a
great
professor
she
is
so
knowledgable
and
her
class
is
very
open
to
participation
she
does
not
give
homework
and
lectures
are
very
important
class
is
very
engaging
since
she
is
lively
and
the
lectures
are
very
applicable
outside
of
class
she
also
tries
to
make
assignments
as
easy
as
possible
and
wants
all
students
to
get
an
a
-----
it'll
be
hard
to
get
an
a
if
you
don't
attend
lectures
she
literally
talks
for
75
minutes
straight
and
doesn't
like
laptops
so
get
ready
to
take
notes
by
hand
assigns
articles
to
read
which
will
be
the
focus
of
the
midterm
pay
attention
to
little
facts
that
seems
unimportant
they
are
-----
topics
discussed
in
class
might
be
a
little
challenging
if
you
are
unfamiliar
with
nyc
or
its
history
of
urban
development
but
as
long
as
you
put
effort
into
researching
and
go
through
all
the
announcement
articles
the
class
would
be
extremely
rewarding
-----
professor
broderick's
lectures
are
as
entertaining
as
hollywood
movies
she
is
also
very
sympathetic
approachable
and
reasonable
my
one
complaint
is
that
she
is
very
euro-centric
-
it
would
have
been
cool
to
learn
about
cities
in
africa
asia
and
the
middle
east
but
we
barely
discussed
them
-
only
talked
about
europe
and
america
-----
really
into
all
her
lectures
wealth
of
knowledge
and
funny
tests
and
papers
are
hard
as
there
is
not
much
guidance
unless
you
ask
for
it
not
the
easiest
grader
but
definitely
wants
the
best
for
all
her
students
loved
this
class
-----
i
took
her
for
arch
of
ny
she
was
such
a
fabulous
professor
with
so
much
knowledge
in
her
field
the
exams
require
a
fair
bit
of
effort
but
she
was
so
clear
and
pleasant
and
the
tas
were
equally
helpful
this
class
made
me
value
a
liberal
arts
education
-----
professor
broderick
was
my
favorite
professor
while
at
nyu
it's
true
that
the
course
is
a
lot
of
memorization
and
it's
not
an
easy
a
but
her
stories
were
fascinating
and
it
was
so
much
fun
to
learn
more
while
exploring
the
city
take
this
class
if
you
want
a
great
experience
and
definitely
walk
around
in
professor
broderick's
group
-----
i
absolutely
love
this
professor
she
knows
her
topics
inside
and
out
and
loves
when
students
have
an
issue
that
they
want
to
talk
about
expects
a
lot
but
is
willing
to
give
second
chances
and
extra
help
will
get
off
topic
but
i
learned
just
as
much
from
her
tangents
really
funny
wit
and
lecturing
style
can't
say
enough
good
things
about
her
-----
i
could
not
have
ever
hoped
for
a
more
helpful
or
kind
professor
deeply
cares
for
her
students
and
somehow
seems
to
know
everyone
personally
she
is
a
very
engaging
lecturer
and
knows
everything
about
her
subject
not
terribly
difficult
if
you
are
in
class
regularly
love
this
woman
-----
the
professor
broderick
and
her
ta's
are
great
but
architecture
of
ny:
a
field
study
is
ridiculous
it's
pure
memorization
of
60
buildings
per
exam
only
to
be
tested
on
8
don't
take
it
as
an
easy
a
map
course
-----
prof
broderick
is
one
of
the
most
fascinating
intellectuals
i
have
ever
had
the
privilege
of
learning
from
she
can
get
side-tracked
easily
so
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
yes
she
expects
a
lot
from
her
students
but
wants
nothing
more
than
for
them
to
succeed
and
will
try
to
accommodate
them
as
much
as
she
can
-----
professor
broderick
is
the
rare
intellectual
who
remains
down-to-earth
and
personable
you
will
not
regret
taking
her
class
-
i
promise
-----
wonderful
teacher
the
sweetest
and
most
caring
professor
i
have
ever
had
she
takes
the
time
to
make
you
understand
and
will
work
with
you
one-on-one
until
you
do
respectful
understanding
hard-working
and
caring
she
has
even
helped
with
job
searching
i
will
try
to
take
her
field
study
course
next
semester
hands
down
best
professor
at
nyu
-----
genuinely
nice
and
interested
in
how
students
are
doing
very
passionate
and
knowledgeable
i'm
a
politics
student
and
even
i
didn't
dread
this
weekly
friday
afternoon
map
class
tas
are
very
approachable
and
competent
best
of
all--they
grade
exams
and
papers
in
a
timely
fashion
exams
take
getting
used
to
but
consider
improvement
for
final
grade
-----
most
unreasonable
professor
i
have
ever
had
first
day
of
class
asked
to
take
the
midterm
early
bc
of
a
conflict
she
said
sure
then
when
the
time
came
tried
to
refuse
to
let
me
take
it
at
all
had
to
take
it
to
dean;
she
let
me
take
it
with
the
final
then
lost
my
final
paper
blamed
it
on
me
and
tried
to
fail
me
delusional
and
a
liar
-----
she
is
a
great
professor
but
sometimes
she
rambles
on
and
on
and
it
is
very
hard
to
keep
up
with
what
she
is
talking
about
also
the
entire
class
grade
is
based
on
one
essay
the
mid-term
and
the
final
so
if
you
screw
up
one
of
those
you're
screwed
-----
extremely
helpful
to
the
students
she
can
drag
on
and
on
about
a
topic
sometimes
but
she
has
a
point
even
in
that
blabbering
i
had
absoluetly
no
interest
in
this
topic
until
i
took
her
class
and
her
passion
and
the
willingness
to
help
her
students
out
led
me
to
major
in
urban
design
def
take
her
class
one
of
the
better
profs
at
nyu
-----
awesome
professor
obviously
passionate
about
the
topic
and
very
open
to
hearing
student
concerns
questions
and
ideas
very
helpful
and
loves
creative
thinking
you
have
to
pay
attention
and
work
in
her
class
but
it's
worth
it
you
won't
be
bored
-----
professor
roth
is
one
of
the
worst
professors
i
have
ever
had
she
assigned
two
quizzes
three
papers
and
a
final
exam
for
the
semester
and
only
ever
got
around
to
grading
two
quizzes
and
nothing
else
she
is
lecture-heavy
and
tests
on
information
that
isn't
discussed
clearly
there
is
also
a
ton
of
reading
don't
take
the
class
unless
you
have
to
-----
lectures
very
heavily
but
i'm
a
heavy
lecture
person
so
that's
fine
for
me
spends
a
lot
of
time
to
grade
hw
i
got
my
essay
i
turned
in
mid
october
in
early
feb
knowledgeable
but
a
bit
disorganized
eager
to
help
and
approachable
in
person
but
not
email
tests
aren't
hard
but
so
many
details
to
remember
my
final
study
guide
was
44
pgs
-----
low
commitment
class
that
will
have
you
write
4
papers
and
take
two
exams
for
a
core
class
that
isn't
bad
the
lectures
are
unstructured
but
taking
good
notes
is
possible
as
long
as
you
sit
in
the
front
so
you
can
catch
what
she
says
posts
study
guides
for
exams
but
doesn't
post
powerpoints
attendance
sheet
passed
around
see
who
is
there
-----
insane
lecture
style
waffles
all
over
the
place
and
mixes
stuff
on
the
exam
with
personal
asides
not
really
textbook
based
and
no
handout
notes
does
not
publish
the
overheads
if
you
invest
the
time
you
can
pass
this
but
i
would
not
take
this
again
-----
took
cultures
and
contexts
knowledgeable
on
the
subject
doesn't
necessarily
translate
to
her
being
an
good
or
even
adequate
professor
goes
off
on
tangents
shows
up
late
not
to
mention
that
she
takes
an
extreme
amount
of
time
to
grade
work
inconsistent
grading
got
my
course
grade
a
month
and
a
half
after
the
semester
ended
do
not
take
-----
professor
roth
is
overly
interested
in
the
subject
and
is
unclear
as
to
what
information
is
relevant
and
what
is
just
her
going
off
on
tangents
incredibly
boring
and
lots
of
work
-----
i
don't
understand
how
she
has
such
low
ratings
i
have
to
agree
with
some
of
the
critiques
about
her
lecture
style
-
she's
so
enthusiastic
about
egypt
that
at
times
she
doesn't
realize
or
perhaps
just
doesn't
care
when
she's
dragging
on
and
on
and
on
however
she's
extremely
helpful
and
understanding
and
i
know
that
by
experience
-----
loves
egypt
but
too
much
would
rather
hear
her
own
voice
than
teach
doesn't
learn
students
names
values
her
social
life
over
class
shows
up
late
often
takes
months
to
grade
papers
that
shouldn't
take
more
than
a
week
two
at
most
constantly
changes
due
dates
unorganized
can't
remember
what
she
has
hasn't
gone
over
got
tenure
&
gave
up
-----
she
gave
interesting
lectures
at
8am
so
it
was
hard
to
stay
awake
midterm
and
final
were
pretty
straight
forward
4
papers
to
write
all
straight
forward
grades
fairly
-----
i
didn't
know
that
art
history
could
be
boring
until
i
had
this
professor
completely
unhelpful
unclear
late
on
returning
emails
assignments
posting
reviews
she
may
just
need
some
more
teacher
training
-----
roth
is
an
organizational
mess
and
always
late
essay
grading
is
skewed;
they
have
a
strange
system
where
your
essays
aren't
graded
by
one
person
but
shuffled
between
roth
and
the
tas
essays
were
graded
anally
midterm
easy
attendance
graded
lectures
unclear
overall
not
an
easy
or
fun
class
take
another
cultures
and
contexts
-----
by
far
the
worst
class
i
have
ever
taken
when
grading
essays
the
professor
and
two
instructors
have
completely
different
and
subjective
approaches
leading
to
an
incorrectly
skewed
grading
curve
of
the
class
recitations
were
enjoyable
but
did
not
relate
to
lectures
lectures
were
unorganized
and
incomprehensible
i
highly
regret
taking
this
class
-----
she
was
such
a
terrible
and
unorganized
professor
it
was
really
difficult
to
study
for
the
final
because
the
textbooks
don't
help
the
lectures
are
disconnected
and
the
class
fails
to
have
an
overarching
theme
it
just
seems
like
a
bunch
of
facts
to
learn
the
tas
were
somewhat
nice
but
even
they
were
pretty
harsh
in
grading
the
essays
-----
this
was
the
worst
class
i
have
ever
taken
i
signed
up
for
it
thinking
that
learning
about
ancient
egypt
would
be
fascinating
but
her
dry
lectures
put
me
to
sleep
and
studying
was
impossible
as
she
never
teaches
from
the
textbooks
i'd
recommend
this
class
if
your
life
revolves
around
the
egyptian
culture
much
like
hers
does
-----
i
had
her
for
culture
&
contexts:
egypt
the
course
was
sort
of
interesting
but
really
have
to
take
good
notes
since
she
doesn't
put
up
powerpoints
points
deducted
for
non-attendance
so
show
up
clear
grading
policy
on
how
to
get
an
a;
just
pay
attention
and
do
well
on
the
final
midterm
2
essays
-----
she
is
a
wonderful
teacher
her
lecture
are
sometimes
confusing
but
if
you
are
confused
a
visit
to
her
office
hours
are
very
helpful
she
has
a
wealth
of
information
to
share
especially
if
you
ask
specific
questions
also
she
is
active
on
dig
sites
in
egypt
giving
her
personal
experience
with
the
material
she
is
teaching
-----
easiest
class
i
ever
took
don't
need
to
read
just
pay
attention
to
what
she
says
in
class
the
stuff
that's
on
the
test
is
stuff
she
says
over
and
over
again
tests
were
exactly
like
the
study
guides
-----
she's
insane
and
rude
the
ta's
are
wonderful
though
-----
lectures
aren't
bad
as
people
say
and
the
material
is
interesting
but
she
refuses
to
post
the
power
points
tends
to
go
over
important
ideas
quickly
while
babbling
about
unimportant
ones
so
you
have
to
be
attentive
in
class
not
easy
a
map
course
&
lots
of
memorization
required
grade
depends
largely
on
your
ta
a
=
good
papers
&
knowledge
of
terms
-----
unbelievably
bad
massive
amounts
of
reading
which
have
often
seem
to
be
simply
punishment
as
they
have
no
connection
to
tests
and
are
far
too
long
to
actually
be
done
i
feel
rather
sad
that
she
is
this
obsessed
with
ancient
egypt
just
when
i
thought
i
knew
the
definition
of
boring
there
ol'
macy
roth
goes
beatin
out
my
expectations
-----
honestly
molly
was
not
the
best
the
class
discussion
was
really
common
sense
stuff
and
i
didn't
feel
like
i
even
learned
much
she
graded
the
papers
super
hard
and
she's
very
writing
intensive
-----
molly
is
a
great
choice
if
you
want
to
learn
enough
but
you're
looking
for
an
easy
a
if
you
just
go
to
class
participate
at
least
once
a
week
day
and
actually
read
you'll
do
well
on
the
one
essay
she
requires
and
if
you
actually
write
what
you've
discussed
in
class
you'll
get
the
a
also
the
midterm
and
final
are
quote
id
-
not
difficult
-----
so
much
reading
always
make
sure
you
have
your
texts
with
you
in
class
or
else
she'll
basically
shame
you
in
front
of
everyone
class
can
be
dry
and
hard
to
stay
awake
for
final
was
easy
-----
professor
martin
was
an
amazing
teacher
for
cf
she
always
came
to
class
with
enthusiasm
and
while
others
thought
it
was
fake
i
can
ensure
you
that
her
kind
and
caring
attitude
is
genuine
she
was
great
with
extra
help
and
gave
students
every
possibility
to
succeed
ie
rewrites
i
learned
a
lot
in
her
class
which
was
my
goal
-----
she
is
an
amazing
professor
she
does
have
an
attitude
that
can
seem
fake
but
overall
she
is
really
nice
and
a
really
fair
grader
there
are
2
tests
an
essay
and
the
final
the
tests
are
text
analysis
but
if
you
listen
in
class
and
do
the
reading
you
will
pass
go
to
her
for
essay
help
and
participate
in
class
and
she
will
like
you
-----
molly
was
one
of
the
nicest
and
most
genuine
professors
i
had
all
year
she
took
the
students'
opinions
into
account
when
coming
up
with
her
teaching
plan
she
was
always
ready
to
give
guidance
or
help
on
a
subject
or
topic
she
definitely
likes
participation
and
if
you
don't
she
will
kinda
drag
it
out
of
you
-----
her
lectures
are
ok
but
her
grades
are
absolute
nonsense
seriously
i
was
so
confused
about
my
grades
the
whole
semester
if
you
get
nervous
about
participating
don't
take
her
class
but
she's
funny
and
looks
like
arizona
from
greys
anatomy
-----
yes
her
nicey
nice
attitude
can
seem
fake
because
it
mostly
is
but
you
should
take
her
class
participation
matters
but
if
you
do
participate
you
will
do
super
well
on
the
tests
she
reviews
in
depth
for
them
and
its
obvious
what
will
be
on
it
she
lets
you
resubmit
the
essay
for
a
new
grade
suck
up
to
her
and
participate
and
you'll
get
an
a
-----
super
sweet
if
you
participate
in
class
she
will
love
you
really
wanted
to
take
her
for
cf
2
but
she
was
unavailable
only
three
easy
tests
-----
prof
martin
is
a
fun
professor
but
expects
participation
she
is
very
open
to
students
coming
to
office
hours
or
emailing
her
with
questions
so
take
advantage
of
that
papers
are
pretty
easy
readings
not
the
most
interesting
but
try
to
keep
up
with
them
because
the
entire
final
is
comprise
of
passage
analysis
-----
molly
is
so
great
not
only
does
she
make
class
interesting
but
she
also
has
a
great
sense
of
humor
that
makes
the
class
relatable
yes
she's
young
but
it
makes
her
more
understanding
she's
a
cool
lady
but
be
prepared
to
read
and
apply
what
you
read
specifically
in
your
exams
-----
great
teacher
genuinely
cares
about
students
and
their
wellbeing
if
you
have
the
option
absolutely
take
her
-----
she
is
easy
in
class
her
essays'
topics
and
guidelines
are
too
ambiguous
and
abstract
she
is
not
very
helpful
when
you
meet
with
her
she
has
her
favorites
so
always
bring
your
texts
to
class
her
materials
are
interesting
if
you
are
interested
in
literature
-----
i
felt
like
i
learned
absolutely
nothing
and
then
i
got
a
bad
grade
for
it
did
pretty
well
on
my
essays
and
exams
but
ended
up
with
a
poor
grade
thank
you
for
wasting
my
tuition
money
and
trying
to
make
my
life
so
much
more
difficult
-----
i
don't
know
why
i'm
stupid
enough
to
take
her
class
again
everything
she
says
is
complete
nonsense
the
grades
are
erratic
her
kindness
is
such
a
facade
she's
so
passive-aggressive
worst
experience
in
my
life
-----
molz
is
really
helpful
and
the
class
itself
is
relatively
easy
if
you
dont
bs
the
papers
-----
unintelligent
pretentious
harsh
grader
patronizing
demeanor
more
suited
to
an
elementary
school
rather
than
a
college
class
actually
would
have
hated
her
then
as
well
the
nice
facade
melts
away
as
soon
as
you
challenge
her
on
anything
fell
asleep
during
another
professor's
presentation
also
not
that
pretty
up
close
-----
don't
get
me
wrong
professor
martin
is
a
very
nice
person
but
if
you
don't
agree
with
her
she
doesn't
like
you
and
thus
makes
you
feel
low
it's
very
obvious
who
her
favorites
are
she's
very
well-educated
and
knows
a
lot
about
the
subjects
she
teaches
but
makes
it
obvious
that
she
knows
a
lot
more
than
you
do
-----
professor
martin
is
the
sweetest
woman
who
actually
cares
about
what
you
think
and
how
you
do
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
she
really
is
brilliant
and
approachable
and
she
is
willing
to
help
her
students
with
any
issue
-----
i
had
molly
for
cultural
ii
and
i
loved
her
the
assignments
were
always
fairly
easy
and
the
texts
she
chose
were
always
interesting
i
was
devastated
when
i
found
out
she
wasn't
teaching
cfiii
this
spring
she's
funny
and
highlights
the
importance
of
the
texts
you
read
so
that
even
if
i
didn't
like
them
i
could
appreciate
them
-----
my
friend
recommended
him
after
taking
him
for
wi
big
mistakes
listening
to
her
he
did
not
help
improve
my
writing
at
all
small
assignments
he
did
not
grade
nor
give
credit
for;
simply
wasted
my
time
because
my
writing
pretty
much
stayed
same
readings
are
ok
but
mostly
jus
used
for
discussion
not
to
better
u
-----
his
grading
was
extremely
subjective;
made
me
write
a
paper
three
times
b
c
he
wanted
more
information
abt
my
mom
despite
me
following
every
part
of
his
guidelines
criteria
did
not
rlly
learn
anything
+
writing
did
not
improve
taking
his
class
a
lot
of
peer
wrk
+
getting
feedback
from
them
when
their
writing
was
jus
horrible
no
help
whatsoever
-----
very
therapeutic
class
participation
matters
as
in
if
you
haven't
done
the
reading
and
he
randomly
calls
on
you
to
comment
then
you're
screwed
but
you
aren't
graded
in
this
so
take
that
as
you
will
-
he'll
probably
just
judge
you
his
feedback
is
great
-
my
writing
definitely
got
better
after
the
class
3-4
graded
essays
total
great
guy
-----
professor
goldfin
was
an
amazing
writing
professor
he
was
able
to
individually
address
each
of
our
struggles
with
writing
and
help
us
evolve
while
also
encouraging
us
to
help
each
other
by
the
end
of
the
class
our
group
was
so
close
and
open
with
each
other
and
none
of
us
were
ready
for
it
to
end
taking
him
again
for
writing
2
next
semester
-----
his
classes
are
very
relaxing
and
therapeutic
there's
a
lot
of
go-around-the-circle
so
as
long
as
you
do
the
homework
you'll
be
fine
he's
really
caring
in
general
and
likes
to
make
time
for
his
students
his
essay
topics
are
always
very
interesting;
i
had
fun
writing
all
of
them
i
highly
recommend
this
class
-----
loved
him
this
class
was
really
easy
and
we
always
had
fun
readings
and
essay
topics
only
4
essays
the
whole
semester
and
reading
responses
were
fun
to
write
i
don't
think
my
writing
improved
all
that
much
but
his
class
was
definitely
my
favorite
from
first
semester
goldfin
is
bae
-----
goldfin
is
such
a
great
teacher
he
is
attentive
to
our
individual
styles
of
writing
and
is
always
available
during
his
office
hours
the
class
itself
is
so
relaxing
and
easy
going
light
readings
almost
every
day
but
they
are
very
important
to
the
essays
he
assigns
love
him
-----
just
take
him
he
is
perfect
no
matter
what
-----
sooooo
sad
that
i'm
not
able
to
take
goldfin
for
writing
ii
literally
so
devastated
i'm
a
writer
by
nature
so
his
more
creative
approach
to
essays
was
very
welcome
tough
grader
and
lots
of
reading
but
the
readings
are
interesting
and
he's
a
really
chill
guy
honestly
it
felt
more
like
therapy
than
a
class
-----
i
loved
this
class
he's
very
creative
and
thinks
a
lot
about
writing
i
really
really
appreciated
the
feedback
he
gave
my
writing
and
loved
the
reading
selections
i
feel
my
writing
improved
yet
the
class
was
a
breeze
i
never
cared
much
about
writing
in
high
school
classes
but
this
class
totally
changed
my
perspective
-----
nice
guy
you
need
to
put
some
effort
into
what
you
write
if
you
enjoy
creative
writing
have
basic
writing
skills
and
listen
closely
to
his
unique
assignments
you
will
find
your
writing
pushed
to
places
you
didn't
expect
it
to
go
and
for
a
writer
this
is
awesome
be
attentive
present
engaged
he
is
a
fair
grader
in
this
criteria
-----
professor
goldfin
was
a
nice
person
and
wasn't
too
difficult
but
he
seemed
to
decide
what
grade
you'd
get
on
the
first
day
of
class
as
everyone
got
almost
the
same
grade
on
all
the
papers
no
matter
how
good
or
bad
they
were
also
what
he'd
tell
you
in
class
wouldn't
match
up
with
the
comments
he'd
leave
on
your
paper
-----
profesor
goldfin
is
wonderful
he
has
a
genuine
interest
in
the
subject
and
he
understands
that
writing
isn't
everyone's
thing
as
long
as
you
do
the
reading
responses
and
put
a
reasonable
amount
of
effort
in
you'll
be
fine
take
his
class
you
won't
regret
it
-----
he
is
a
great
teacher
and
is
very
helpful
i
can
truly
say
i've
learned
a
lot
from
him
the
work
is
pretty
easy
there
are
only
4
essays
and
weekly
literature
reflection
papers
-however
the
grade
you
receive
is
completely
up
in
the
air
i
attended
all
the
classes
and
did
the
work
however
i
got
a
b+
for
the
semester
-----
took
him
for
writing
i
he's
very
easy
and
the
work
load
is
manageable
but
his
grading
is
kind
of
out
of
the
blue
but
i
feel
like
with
all
writing
professors
you
could
be
a
great
writer
but
if
they
don't
like
your
style
you
won't
get
an
a
i'd
still
recommend
him
though
-----
professor
goldfin
is
truly
a
wonderful
teacher
his
class
has
an
easy
going
pace
and
he
always
gives
you
a
chance
to
rewrite
if
you
don't
like
your
grade
he
taught
me
so
much
about
the
process
of
writing
an
essay
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
in
his
class
i
highly
recommend
him
to
anyone
taking
writing
1
-----
i
loved
professor
goldfin
the
workload
is
nothing
close
to
overwhelming
--
there
is
a
major
piece
of
essay
due
every
few
weeks
and
in
between
he
assigns
great
essays
to
read
that
relate
to
the
piece
of
writing
the
class
is
working
on
he
allows
you
to
revise
and
will
occasionally
change
your
grade
once
you
get
used
to
him
it's
a
great
class
-----
before
students
pick
him:
read
this
first:
it
is
a
serious
risk
he
is
unfair
in
his
grading
some
of
my
friends
in
his
class
are
doing
fine
if
you
get
an
a
on
the
1st
paper
you'll
be
fine
for
the
rest
of
the
class
but
everyone
else
is
practically
ordained
a
b
even
if
you
go
see
him
for
help
on
your
essay
that
doesn't
guarantee
youll
do
well
-----
teacher
is
really
nice
but
you
dont
really
do
anything
in
the
class
insanely
boring
and
hes
very
anal
about
the
smallest
things
like
grammar
on
papers
but
if
you
talk
a
lot
in
class
he'll
give
you
a
good
grade
i
found
him
annoying
but
other
kids
liked
him
i
rather
take
mary
roma
-----
great
professor
interesting
essays
reading
responses
are
annoying
but
doable
not
a
heavy
workload
if
you
can
take
him
do
not
pass
the
chance
an
a
is
definitely
possible
-----
if
you
are
someone
who
enjoys
writing
the
class
itself
is
pretty
boring
no
matter
which
professor
you
have
prof
jackson
makes
the
best
of
it
as
he
is
a
very
experienced
writer
and
is
fun
to
listen
to
he
engages
the
class
well
with
current
issues
and
is
eager
to
hear
different
perspectives
-----
a
bit
unorganized
but
easy
a
if
you
do
all
optional
drafts
and
read
your
daily
writings
in
class
3
major
essays
and
2
article
analysis
-----
i
learned
so
much
in
this
writing
course
not
sure
why
students
did
not
like
him
great
professor
-----
great
guy
and
a
really
good
conversationalist
but
he
is
a
very
hard
grader
he
values
our
in
class
discussions
so
attendance
is
a
must
but
the
topics
are
very
interesting
so
it
wasn't
a
big
deal
be
prepared
to
have
to
read
a
lot
and
try
to
space
his
work
out
over
the
semester
because
there
is
way
too
much
for
you
to
cram
last
minute
-----
easy
a
and
really
nice
guy
participation
is
important
kind
of
boring
class
but
i
think
that's
mainly
because
my
section
was
pretty
quiet
so
the
discussions
were
always
pretty
dead
-----
he's
a
brutal
grader
and
i
mean
that
in
the
best
way
possible
his
advice
is
incredibly
valuable
and
he's
always
happy
to
give
it
this
is
the
first
writing
class
i
have
ever
struggled
in
and
i
couldn't
be
more
excited
-----
if
you
are
looking
to
actually
get
better
at
writing
professor
jackson
is
your
guy
everyone
on
here
complains
that
he
is
a
tough
grader
but
when
you
finally
get
that
a
it
is
the
best
subject
matter
is
really
interesting
expect
nightly
readings
i
have
grown
so
much
as
a
writer
-----
he
gives
great
advice
about
writing
in
general
but
doesn't
read
your
stories
that
closely
&
can't
keep
track
of
your
characters
he
doesn't
show
up
to
class
on
time
or
apologize
for
not
doing
so;
never
has
his
notes
or
prompts
cued
up
and
takes
forever
to
find
them
if
you
like
professors
that
are
more
like
students
take
him
otherwise
don't
-----
take
professor
jackson
if
you
want
to
improve
your
writing
skills
he
is
a
fountain
of
knowledge
regarding
creative
non
fiction
and
can
offer
you
valuable
lessons
if
you
make
the
effort
to
professor
jackson
an
a
is
a
perfect
score
and
he
wants
to
see
improvement
so
don't
expect
a
high
grade
on
your
first
drafts
he's
a
cool
dude
too
-----
professor
jackson
is
a
tough
grader
but
you
will
learn
how
to
write
in
his
classes
taking
his
classes
will
positively
prepare
you
to
write
a
great
thesis
paper
come
senior
year
come
to
his
classes
having
done
the
assigned
readings
do
the
in
class
writing
assignments
and
the
weekly
paper
and
you
will
be
fine
-----
knows
all
about
hip
hop
his
classes
are
interesting
plus
he
is
always
willing
to
help
you
just
read
the
texts
and
you'll
do
fine
really
gave
me
some
good
writing
advice
-----
i
see
most
people
complaining
about
him
not
being
an
easy
grader
and
making
you
work
for
it
but
what
people
do
not
know
is
that
when
mitchell
was
giving
good
grades
for
good
work
he
was
accused
by
a
student
for
being
an
easy
grader
and
that's
fact
i
guess
you
can't
win
for
losing
on
this
one
i
learned
a
lot
from
him
and
i
am
satisfied
with
my
b+
-----
easy
b
if
you
work
for
it
and
you
have
to
read
or
else
you
wont
pass
there
are
journal
writings
everyday
and
attendance
counts
assignments
are
due
promptly
and
papers
can
either
make
your
grade
or
break
it
the
choice
is
yours
as
there
are
lots
of
resources
available
for
you
to
pass
&
presentation
at
last
week
-----
run
very
far
hard
to
please
-----
funny
great
guy
but
difficult
to
please
difficult
to
get
and
a
run
very
far
find
another
teacher
if
you
want
an
a
he
gives
you
a
bad
grade
doesn't
wanna
talk
about
why
and
how
to
improve
come
man
chill
out
-----
extremely
hard
to
please
never
seems
satisfied
with
your
essays
nor
re-writes
not
to
mention
never
answers
his
emails
although
knows
everyone
in
hip-hop
he
never
cares
about
his
students
always
late
-sometimes
doesn't
show
up
so
don't
bother
showing
up
early
to
impress
him-
nothing
impresses
him
doesn't
like
dorks
-----
the
worst
writing
professor
ever
you
start
out
your
essay
with
a
possible
b-
picks
favorites
harsh
grader
don't
take
him
-----
you
would
appreciate
your
improvement
in
writing
so
much
more
after
you
have
taken
this
class
my
writing
improved
so
much
and
he
gives
clear
advice
on
ways
to
improve
he's
pretty
funny
and
interesting
so
it
helps
you
stay
engaged
participate
and
you
would
appreciate
class
more
-----
cool
man
very
helpful
and
funny
i
enjoyed
his
class
very
much
-----
he
is
so
cool
and
can
really
help
you
improve
your
writing
-----
i
learned
a
lot
and
sana
is
a
great
person
but
lectures
are
really
not
so
meaningful
she
grades
very
leniently
which
makes
the
class
pretty
easy
but
lectures
can
be
super
hard
to
follow
sometimes
had
to
teach
myself
a
bunch
of
stuff
overall
good
class
bc
i
didn't
know
anything
beforehand
and
was
not
so
hard
but
not
a
challenging
course
-----
the
myriad
of
spelling
errors
in
the
code
the
assignments
and
even
in
the
exams
themselves
reflect
extremely
poorly
on
the
instructor
a
few
typos
are
okay
here
and
there
but
the
sheer
lack
of
effort
on
all
the
material
was
appalling
and
made
it
so
that
doing
the
homework
and
answering
questions
on
the
actual
exam
was
extremely
confusing
-----
easiest
class
and
easiest
prof
i
have
ever
taken
when
the
midterm
avg
was
90
she
gave
a
5pt
curve
bc
she
felt
we
had
to
write
too
much
we
didn't
so
i
got
a
101
on
the
exam
i
never
went
to
class
easiest
a
i
have
ever
received
in
college
-----
class
is
pretty
easy
to
do
well
in
i
had
no
issues
at
all
and
was
able
to
gather
everything
i
needed
for
assignments
and
tests
on
her
website
so
i
barely
went
to
class
overall
pretty
easy
and
super
nice
professor
-----
definite
easy
a
hws
are
really
simple--
the
examples
she
give
in
class
satisfies
the
hw
requirements
so
you
can
build
onto
those
the
exams
are
almost
exactly
like
the
practice
exams
she
gives
extra
credits
for
hws
and
exams
directions
can
be
a
bit
unclear
sometimes
overall
take
her
for
a
gpa
boost
-----
sana
was
difficult
to
understand
both
in
person
and
on
her
website
for
the
class
her
grading
criteria
sometimes
didn't
make
sense
i
struggled
with
the
homework
and
had
to
learn
a
lot
through
online
tutorials
she
did
help
me
as
i
struggled
with
the
semester
and
was
very
lenient
with
grading
but
i
didn't
enjoy
the
class
-----
not
difficult
enough
she
is
a
pretty
good
teacher
and
is
extremely
nice
but
everything
was
a
little
too
easy
compared
to
other
python
classes
i've
seen
i
would
do
the
hw
in
class
as
soon
as
it
was
assigned
-----
sana
is
a
great
professor
and
all-around
amazing
person
she's
extremely
understanding
to
any
issues
and
always
made
lectures
more
like
a
discussion
with
friends
rather
than
monotonous
lecturing
-----
a
very
unclear
professor
the
material
isn't
hard
but
she
makes
it
seem
that
way
she
asked
our
class
to
close
our
computersduring
a
computer
science
course
i'd
recommend
against
better
people
teach
this
required
course
for
comp
sci
majors
-----
amazing
person
but
one
of
the
most
boring
and
not
very
clear
professors
that
i
had
you
will
most
likely
find
yourself
learning
more
from
the
textbook
than
from
an
actual
class
-----
assignments
and
exams
are
difficult
but
is
heavily
curved
up
if
your
code
has
bugs
you
only
lose
a
few
meager
points
unless
it
is
absolutely
terrible
easy
a
as
for
the
teaching
it's
decent
-----
she
was
awesome
always
available
through
e-mail
if
not
in
person
and
grades
very
generously
even
though
she
says
she
takes
a
lot
of
points
off
if
she
is
teaching
a
computer
science
class
take
it
-----
she's
kind
and
zealous
however
she
seldom
manages
to
explain
her
assignment
well
though
she
tried
-----
professor
is
very
knowledgeable
and
explains
concepts
very
well
professor
odeh
is
very
helpful
and
accessible
her
exams
and
assignments
are
hard
but
if
you
study
and
keep
up
with
class
work
you
will
be
able
to
do
wells
i
highly
recommend
professor
odeh
classes
-----
her
style
of
teaching
is
too
fast
for
me
otherwise
i
think
her
style
is
ok
she
does
use
some
newer
techniques
but
keeps
some
old
techniques
as
well
especially
the
style
of
the
code
textbook
is
useless
and
is
not
necessary
she
has
office
hours
but
tend
to
be
busy
and
prefers
you
to
go
to
tutoring
or
ask
your
grader
tests
are
way
too
long
-----
easy
a
the
methods
taught
can
be
outdated
due
to
continuous
changes
in
java
development
tests
can
be
long
but
are
quite
simple
if
the
question
involves
coding
it
is
usually
very
similar
to
the
assignments
the
game
programming
assignment
is
easier
considering
it
is
just
group
work
no
presentations
easy
short
assignments
long
but
easy
tests
-----
she
is
a
nice
prof
and
understandable
but
a
little
bit
outdated
and
she
makes
her
class
always
feel
like
teaching
just
several
active
student
but
her
tests
are
pretty
easy
easy
a
generally
if
you
attend
her
classes
and
listen
carefully
-----
everything
she
teaches
is
pretty
outdated
in
a
computers-based
course
it
would
make
sense
to
keep
up
with
current
programs
and
tech
but
she
apparently
doesn't
realize
that
every
app
she
exemplifies
is
8
years
and
4
versions
too
old
to
be
of
much
use
in
the
present
-----

i
saw
such
great
ratings
of
sana
here
and
took
the
course
now
i
think
a
few
of
these
might've
been
written
by
herself
b
c
she's
not
as
nice
sort
of
condescending
at
office
hours
and
def
picks
favorites
she
really
loves
this
1boy
in
our
class
she
taught
us
arrays
like
the
last
two
days
of
class
and
expects
us
to
know
it
for
the
final
crazyyyy
-----
she
is
beyond
strict
with
absences
and
late
arrivals
her
class
is
mandatory
so
there
is
nothing
much
you
can
do
about
it
-----
being
boring
strict
and
arrogant:
anyone
can
have
two
of
them
and
still
be
a
good
professor
being
all
three
is
a
rare
talent
and
peggy
just
has
it
her
attendance
policy
is
beyond
understandable
and
the
class
content
is
nearly
useless
i
can
not
judge
her
as
a
person
but
her
classroom
experience
is
definitely
uncomfortable
-----
peggy
oh
peggy
she's
the
only
teacher
for
performance
strategies
so
at
least
you
will
have
a
bonding
experience
with
all
your
classmates
her
lectures
are
so
boring
she's
really
easy
tho
so
my
suggestion
is
sit
in
the
back
so
you
can
just
go
on
your
phone
the
recitations
are
the
only
things
that
matter
because
she
doesn't
teach
them
-----
very
tough
on
attendance
however
if
you
just
show
up
and
do
the
work
you'll
pass
she's
definetly
a
bit
annoying
as
a
teacher
but
you
can
actually
learn
a
lot
from
her
class
-----
tough
on
attendance
but
a
good
prof
who
knows
what
she's
talking
about
some
people
don't
like
her
because
she's
a
stickler
for
rules
but
it's
worth
it
to
take
her
-----
i
graduated
from
tisch
2
years
ago
and
was
on
their
site
and
almost
gave
back
my
lunch
when
i
read
which
teachers
have
been
given
title
distinguished
who
rates
them
-
their
childen
gormley
and
julie
sloane
and
susan
sandler
and
alice
elliott
i
had
the
misfortune
of
having
all
four
and
would
rate
them
similarly
horrible
-----
ugh
remember
the
nuns
you
hated
in
catholic
school
she's
worse
scary
dull
and
incredibly
strict
and
i
think
she
thinks
she's
a
famous
actress
-----
this
women
is
dreadful
she
thinks
meryl
streep
is
over-rated
is
obsessed
with
marlon
brando
and
reminds
me
of
every
bad
teacher
i
had
in
catholic
school
she
spends
more
time
making
up
rules
then
teaching
she
seems
very
bitter
and
thinks
she
is
the
best
actress
in
the
world
talks
about
herself
constantly
-----
peggy's
lectures
are
incredibly
boring
and
useless
she
rambles
on
about
sidney
lumet
marlon
brando
and
her
personal
experiences
i
can't
name
a
thing
i
learned
in
her
class
but
it's
required
so
good
luck
-----
caring
teacher
but
doesn't
give
you
room
to
learn
on
your
own
or
discover
things
yourself
lots
of
in-class
exercises
as
well
not
my
favorite
tisch
prof
but
she's
still
pretty
good
-----
i'm
impressed
by
how
little
i
learned
given
how
much
time
i
spent
in
this
class
unfortunately
it
is
required
and
she
is
the
only
professor
-----
yuck
this
woman
actually
gives
pop
quizzes
she
is
completely
self-centered
and
obsessed
with
marlon
brando
treats
you
like
your
five
boring
except
when
she
talks
about
herself
her
favorite
subject
don't
take
unless
you
are
forced
to
-----
i
think
peggy
is
very
misunderstood
sure
she
gets
angry
easily
and
calls
people
out
but
hey
she
was
intimidating
but
effective
the
lectures
didn't
stand
out
to
me
much
but
were
informative
but
the
speech
peggy
gave
on
the
last
day
of
class
was
the
most
inspiring
thing
i've
heard
since
i
came
to
tisch
if
every
class
ended
like
that
wow
-----
the
class
peggy
teaches
is
easy
peggy
however
is
not
easy
if
you
arrive
even
one
second
late
she'll
give
you
a
late
ticket
if
you
fall
asleep
she'll
mark
your
grade
down
she
treats
the
entire
class
like
high
schoolers
all
she
ever
talks
about
is
her
career
and
marlon
brando
stay
awake
and
go
to
class
and
you'll
get
an
a
-----
as
you
can
see
peggy
is
a
very
divisive
professor
personally
i
didn't
like
her
i
thought
she
was
petty
arrogant
and
disrespectful
she
says
a
lot
of
stupid
stuff
about
writing
and
directing
at
the
same
time
she
certainly
knows
her
stuff
with
acting
and
actors
so
try
to
be
open
to
what
she
has
to
say
on
that
front
ignore
everything
else
-----
oh
peggy
peggy
this
course
is
extremely
important
in
the
directing
student
curriculum
and
peggy
ruined
all
the
interest
i
had
in
learning
about
anything
she
taught
her
constant
calls
for
the
class
to
be
silent
not
to
eat
not
to
look
at
each
other
not
to
breathe
distract
everyone
you
will
be
drained
and
stressed
after
every
single
class
-----
knows
what
she's
talking
about
but
fails
to
connect
and
control
the
classroom
very
old
school
and
refuses
to
see
that
the
world
is
evolving
plus
she's
one
of
those
professors
that
hammers
the
whole
artist
thing
down
your
throat
and
tries
to
convince
your
grades
et
cetera
don't
matter
*she's
an
actres
that's
important
to
know
-----
peggy
is
an
iconic
freshman
lecturer
everybody
respects
and
recognises
her
she
shares
wonderful
insights
into
the
industry
and
focuses
on
things
that
really
matter
you
will
find
her
lectures
interesting
if
you
are
into
directing
techniques
and
performance
analysis
her
humour
is
eccentric
and
funny
attendance
is
crucial
if
you
want
to
get
an
a
-----
peggy
is
eccentric
though
sometimes
a
bit
impatient
with
her
classes
her
lectures
are
a
good
30
minutes
longer
than
most
feel
is
necessary
but
she
gives
great
insight
to
the
world
of
the
actor
and
directing
she's
quite
the
name
dropper
and
her
class
is
almost
entirely
attendance
based
but
overall
is
a
good
fit
for
the
course
-----
peggy
is
full
of
great
stories
and
insights
a
seasoned
industry
vet
a
little
eccentric
but
she's
an
actress
what
do
you
expect
very
fun
class
if
a
little
long
at
times
peggy
is
a
cool
lady
-----
rutigliano
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
people
i
have
ever
met
there's
many
moments
in
our
class
that
i
will
remember
forever
especially
the
field
trip
to
the
cloisters
he
is
incredible
insightful
about
the
subject
matter
and
life
as
a
whole
however
the
course
is
very
lecture
heavy
with
many
tangents
-
it
can
get
very
dry
very
quickly
-----
that
rare
kind
of
professor
who
can
completely
change
the
way
you
see
the
world
his
love
of
knowledge
is
absolutely
contagious
and
you
are
guaranteed
to
learn
something
new
about
the
subject
and
about
yourself
in
his
class
-----
professor
is
awesome
not
a
drag
he
keeps
you
interested
with
his
class
and
makes
you
think
outside
the
box
i
would
take
him
again
if
i
could
-----
out
of
all
the
schools
and
all
the
classes
all
over
the
world
this
man
has
made
more
of
an
impact
on
my
world
view
and
personal
life
than
everything
put
together
it's
more
than
the
easy
a
it's
the
knowledge
and
passion
he
has
for
history
that
for
the
first
time
i
enjoyed
learning
and
imagining
people
from
th
from
that
era
he's
unconventional
-----
teacher's
teacher
his
passion
for
the
subject
matter
is
contageous
-----
best
professor
i've
ever
had
hands
down
gives
you
an
a
as
long
as
he
can
tell
you're
putting
in
effort
he's
very
funny
and
knows
more
than
anyone
i've
ever
met
i
wish
all
of
my
professors
were
this
knowledgeable
easy
pop
quizzes
if
you
read
5
1-2
page
papers
and
1
6-8
page
epic
1
in
class
presentation
and
a
trial
at
the
end
of
the
semester
-----
this
is
really
an
amazing
professor
it
wasnt
up
until
the
second
to
last
class
that
i
finally
understood
what
he
was
saying
this
is
a
meaning
of
life
class
he
opens
your
eyes
to
a
different
view
of
the
world
and
leaves
you
amazed
highly
recommend
-----
not
very
understanding
at
all
he
appears
to
very
friendly
and
likable
during
class
however
when
you
are
seeking
help
and
understanding
for
the
inevitability
of
certain
events
zero
sympathy
and
understanding
are
given
-----
transformation
-
enough
said
take
his
class
and
you'll
understand
-----
rutigliano
is
an
amazing
professor
and
really
cares
a
great
deal
about
his
students
the
class
is
easy
but
he
makes
it
like
that
for
a
reason
he
knows
students
are
only
there
for
a
grade
yet
somehow
he's
so
inspiring
that
i
end
up
reading
every
book
he
assigns
during
my
free
time
best
prof
at
nyu
hands
down
i
have
taken
4
classes
with
him
-----
i've
taken
two
classes
with
rutigliano
and
i
dare
anyone
to
find
a
more
inspiring
and
innovative
professor
at
nyu
or
any
other
school
this
man
is
an
encyclopedia
he
knows
everything
and
at
the
same
time
understands
how
to
teach
things
in
a
way
that
makes
students
want
to
learn
you
will
love
his
class
and
love
him
i
promise
-----
easy
a
he
is
great
-----
he's
the
best
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
at
first
i
was
a
little
lost
he
has
this
adorable
accent
and
is
very
passionate
when
he
speaks
about
history
but
his
methods
and
approach
to
teaching
is
absolutely
wonderful
and
inspiring
he
definitely
makes
you
t
-----
rutigliano
i'm
sure
is
a
good
person
&
a
good
professor
but
as
an
advisor
he
is
very
very
very
hard
to
get
in-touch
with
maybe
he
should
give
up
the
advising
gig
although
he
is
good
at
it
-----
his
classes
were
fun
inspiring
very
knowledgable
but
also
very
haphazard
you
can
get
by
regurgitating
but
he
loves
and
inspires
when
you
bring
new
material
to
the
table
a
fun
advisor
walking
prozac
-----
absolute
genius
ridiculous
knowledge
but
no
pretension
such
a
great
teacher
just
amazing
only
person
in
gallatin
[teacher
faculty
student]
that
i've
met
that
isn't
a
total
ass
-----
he's
the
best
professore
was
the
man
and
i'd
take
any
class
he
offered
-----
i
love
this
man
-----
he's
a
smart
guy
and
his
lectures
and
discussions
can
be
fun
and
interesting
but
the
class
itself
is
very
badly
put
together:
basically
just
regurgitate
what
he
says
in
class
on
the
tests
it's
kind
of
ironic
that
he
rails
against
phenomenal
thinking
and
the
outmoded
educational
system
yet
that
is
exactly
how
his
class
is
structured
-----
he
does
a
great
job
of
giving
students
a
taste
of
the
subject
his
classes
are
not
as
rigorous
as
they
could
be
but
they
are
an
entertaining
introduction
he's
an
incredibly
passionate
teacher
-----
professor
kellogg's
classes
are
known
to
be
very
easy
and
require
little
work
and
this
was
true
in
this
class
the
material
he
presents
in
lectures
and
the
studies
that
you
learn
about
in
class
are
interesting
and
relevant
my
main
problem
is
he
sometimes
says
things
that
are
kind
of
offensive
to
women
and
he
doesn't
really
realize
it
-----
easiest
a
and
it's
not
just
because
this
class
is
interesting
but
also
because
prof
kellogg
is
such
a
great
lecturer
who
cares
about
his
students
we
need
more
professors
like
him
at
nyu
you
run
very
interesting
labs
in
spss
with
your
peers
there's
a
midterm
based
on
class
terms
and
a
final
which
you
do
in
groups
overall
great
class
-----
you
can
take
this
class
for
the
content
but
expect
to
memorize
200
slides
for
every
exam
know
how
to
write
every
single
word
on
each
exam
that
weighs
33%
each
and
don't
expect
to
get
any
extra
credit
take
it
as
pass
fail
if
you
care
about
your
grade
great
information
horrible
class
structure
he
discourages
learning
encourages
memorization
-----
prof
kellogg
is
the
best
psych
professor
at
nyu
his
class
is
super
easy
and
he
allows
you
fix
all
the
labs
you
mess
up
on
the
midterm
exam
is
based
on
one
lecture
and
the
final
is
a
group
lab
assignment
just
show
up
&
try
and
you
will
get
an
a
he
even
has
an
extra
credit
opportunity
the
paper
was
tricky
but
manageable
overall
he's
amazing
-----
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
courses
i've
taken
at
nyu
if
you
end
up
taking
this
class
i
guarantee
you
that
you
will
learn
a
lot
about
drug
addiction
just
make
sure
that
you're
able
to
memorize
over
200
slides
since
your
exams
will
be
based
on
them
grading
criteria
is
pretty
simple:
2
out
of
3
best
exams
will
determine
your
final
grade
-----
i
took
addiction
with
kellogg
there
were
3
exams
that
made
up
your
entire
grade
and
they
were
based
off
of
the
lecture
slides
put
online
if
you
memorize
the
slides
then
you'll
ace
the
exams
you
don't
have
to
go
to
class-
he
even
says
anything
he
says
in
class
won't
be
on
the
exam
only
the
slides
lectures
are
interesting
but
not
imperative
-----
i
enjoy
the
class
but
the
professor
isn't
very
engaging
in
addition
his
exams
most
definitely
no
longer
take
10
minutes
each
exam
had
over
100
short
answer
questions
that
required
straight
memorization
from
200
slides
of
information
don't
take
this
class
if
you
want
an
easy
a
because
you
actually
have
to
work
for
it
now
-----
the
exams
are
all
short
answer
with
very
few
multiple
choice
so
make
sure
you
memorize
the
important
details
which
can
be
many
i
went
into
this
course
not
expecting
much
but
now
i
am
seriously
considering
doing
something
involved
with
addiction
treatment
in
short
this
course
has
really
changed
the
direction
of
my
life
thanks
professor
-----
this
can
be
an
easy
class
to
pass
with
a
good
grade
if
you
memorize
the
material
for
the
three
exams
i
don't
know
why
but
i
enjoy
having
this
class
in
the
morning
it's
an
interesting
topic
and
very
easy
going
to
have
in
the
morning
when
there
is
a
movie
documentary
almost
every
week
pertaining
to
the
drug
topic
and
class
is
usually
full
too
-----
this
class
was
a
joke
i
never
skip
classes
but
i
stopped
attending
his
he
shows
movies
just
about
every
class
and
reads
off
slides
he
puts
online
all
of
his
exams
take
10
min
max
and
i
learned
almost
nothing
new
i
don't
know
how
he
can
take
a
paycheck
from
nyu
in
good
conscience
when
he
puts
in
so
little
effort
teaching
-----
easiest
a
i've
ever
gotten
he
grades
the
labs
for
each
class
pass
fail
and
he
lets
you
redo
them
if
you
fail
or
miss
it
for
exams
he
only
had
a
midterm
and
a
final
he
gives
you
a
cheat
sheet
for
the
midterm
which
has
25
terms
definition
to
remember
and
the
final
was
just
running
data
on
spss
which
took
less
than
30mins
-----
great
professor
easy
a
if
you
put
some
work
in
whoever
said
he
doesn't
care
is
a
****
this
guy
is
amazing
-----
attendance
is
not
mandatory
but
for
some
reason
the
class
is
full
everyday
especially
at
9:30am
this
is
rare
students
are
obviously
going
for
a
reason
i
enjoy
this
class
early
in
the
morning
he
throws
jokes
in
sometimes
which
is
nice
very
easy
to
talk
to
and
he
covers
important
material
related
to
the
subject
-----
in
3
words
-
he
doesn't
care
the
final
exam
takes
15
min
to
complete
he
gives
a
cheat
sheet
of
the
answers
the
day
before
he
is
passive
aggressively
trying
to
hurt
nyu
by
not
teaching
anything
constructive
instead
his
students
watch
movies
he
got
from
the
hallmark
channel
the
fact
that
his
whole
class
gets
an
a
should
be
a
red
flag
that
he
suck
-----
taking
lab
in
psychopathology
with
him
now
this
is
the
second
time
i've
had
him
as
a
teacher
and
he
is
by
far
the
best
psychology
teacher
at
nyu
easy
but
interesting
and
fun
take
any
class
with
him
you
can
-----
i
love
him
i
think
he
is
hot
the
class
was
an
easy
a
he
tells
you
exactly
what
is
going
to
be
on
the
tests
and
the
majority
of
a
test
was
just
listing
terms
that
he
gives
you
in
class
one
thing
that
i
had
a
problem
with
was
that
sometimes
he
would
speed
through
his
slides
which
he
does
not
post
either
have
the
book
and
don't
go
to
class
or
go
-----
one
of
the
easiest
classes
ever
just
do
the
study
guides
study
the
night
before
so
it's
fresh
in
your
mind
and
you'll
get
an
a
prof
kellogg
is
funny
and
although
attendance
in
not
mandatory
you
should
go
for
his
stories
very
interesting
course
with
interesting
movies
-----
i
heart
scotty
k
you
must
take
this
class
this
guy
is
awesome
don't
let
people
ruin
the
class
and
complain
about
it
being
too
easyyeah
it's
easy
but
i
actually
wanted
to
go
to
this
class
a
large
detour
from
my
lack
of
attendance
in
other
classes
::coughs
social
psych::
-----
this
is
an
easy
a
class
minimal
stuying
involved
it
can
get
a
little
unchallenging
and
then
you
question
the
prof's
tenure
status
but
i
look
forward
to
having
him
in
a
small
class
setting
-----
best
professor
i
ever
had
there's
just
an
awesomeness
about
him
-----
honestly
not
an
easy
a
class
but
amazing
lectures
his
class
is
helpful
in
a
way
that
he
really
requires
us
to
understand
the
material
instead
of
merely
how
to
solve
the
problem
the
class
may
seem
confusing
at
first
but
you
will
likely
find
the
class
interesting
when
you
get
to
know
his
style
and
understand
his
words
-----
bisin
is
probably
a
good
researcher
but
he
really
doesn't
know
how
to
teach
undergraduate
students
who
are
new
to
statistics
he
is
terrible
at
math
so
he
leaves
everything
to
the
conceptual
level
his
lectures
are
very
confusing
sometimes
he
gets
himself
lost
it
is
possible
to
ace
the
exams
but
you
need
to
self
study
a
lot
of
materials
-----
bisin
overall
is
okay
i
would
say
very
nice
guy
funny
and
cares
about
students
learning
make
sure
you
go
to
class
and
write
down
every
word
because
he
doesn't
go
by
the
book
and
will
test
you
on
what
you
did
in
class
if
you
have
seher
gupta
for
recitation
you're
lucky
and
make
sure
you
go
for
all
of
them
she
is
amazing
and
taught
me
everythin
-----
do
not
take
his
class
he
is
a
very
nice
person
and
genuinely
cares
about
your
learning
but
that
results
in
him
not
caring
about
your
grade
he
is
extremely
vague
about
his
exams
and
tests
and
won't
tell
you
anything
you'll
have
maybe
2-3
questions
for
the
entire
midtermfinal
and
they'll
be
mad
hard
just
do
yourself
favor
and
avoid
him
-----
i'm
still
not
entirely
sure
why
nyu
has
such
great
intro
teachers
but
not
one
decent
intermediate
one
bisin
is
a
good
guy
but
he
will
challenge
you
and
make
you
work
hard
he
thinks
spending
5-6
hours
on
a
problem
set
which
you'll
get
every
week
is
the
norm
and
you
should
be
stuck
and
have
to
think
it
over
the
structure
of
the
class
is
weird
-----
curriculum
is
poorly
constructed
involving
jumping
from
topic
to
topic
without
much
depth
or
explanation
lectures
are
unclear
bisin
frequently
goes
entire
lectures
without
explaining
even
the
basic
concepts
behind
each
problem
leaving
even
the
most
interested
students
lost
however
he
is
a
funny
and
interesting
guy
-----
he
has
no
book
for
the
class
this
is
not
an
introductory
class
but
instead
an
advanced
and
quickly
moving
survey
of
microeconomic
principles
and
topics
i
don't
understand
how
he
is
still
teaching
aside
from
tenure
and
research
contributions
arrogant
and
comes
off
as
unhelpful
-----
i
pay
attention
in
class
yet
learn
little
he
skips
multiple
steps
and
often
tells
you
more
about
what
you
will
learn
rather
than
actually
teach
it
you
don't
know
what
is
important
and
things
are
taught
in
random
order
when
i
look
at
homework
sets
i
don't
know
what
i'm
even
supposed
to
do
he's
a
cool
smart
guy
but
not
a
great
teacher
-----
bisin
gives
off
the
charts
interesting
lectures
they
are
not
always
directly
related
to
the
material
but
they
are
very
engaging
and
entertaining
he
is
very
kind
and
helpful
to
students
who
approach
him
he
can
come
off
as
a
bit
intimidating
at
first
but
he
is
a
great
guy
incredibly
helpful
to
students
who
make
an
effort
in
the
class
and
with
him
-----
bisin
is
not
a
great
communicator
or
teacher
making
the
material
difficult
to
understand
there
seemed
to
be
no
structure
to
the
class
and
many
people
seemed
lost
he
asks
little
of
his
students
though
making
it
easy
enough
to
get
a
good
grade
without
truly
comprehending
the
material
-----
bisin
moves
fast
very
fast
classes
seem
scattered
and
material
can
seem
difficult
at
times
but
it
makes
sense
if
you
can
keep
up
with
it
make
sure
you're
interested
in
the
subject
beforehand
-----
class
is
in
dire
need
of
a
real
textbook
prof's
notes
are
whimsical
unpolished
and
not
nearly
comprehensive
enough
basically
if
you
ever
don't
get
something
you're
screwed
-----
bisin
is
a
brilliant
economist
but
not
that
great
of
a
teacher
he
knows
and
understands
the
material
in
his
own
mind
and
in
his
own
language
italian
but
struggles
to
convey
the
principles
simply
to
his
students
however
he
would
be
a
much
better
teacher
if
he
asked
more
of
his
students
ie
its
possible
to
get
by
without
doing
any
work
-----
the
class
is
a
difficult
one
-
don't
take
it
if
you're
not
sure
about
whether
you
can
deal
with
the
amount
of
mathematics
in
it
i
changed
to
the
policy
track
after
it
he's
a
really
knowledgeable
guy
and
he
loves
what
he's
doing
-
but
he's
not
particularly
into
an
easy
approach
dives
right
into
it
assuming
everybody's
going
to
be
following
him
-----
okay
everyone
who
keeps
complaining
that
microeconomics
should
be
a
prerequisite
obviously
never
took
microecon
therefore
has
no
grounds
to
say
it
should
be
a
prereq
its
not
for
a
reason
if
your
good
at
math
you
will
do
well
in
this
class
regardless
of
prior
econ
knowledge
-----
very
intense
not
much
help
if
you
don't
have
a
background
of
the
course
-----
you
should
know
principles
well
and
you
should
be
familiar
with
basic
calc
the
economic
intuition
is
explained
in
class
but
it
might
go
over
your
head
if
you
have
no
econ
background
and
don't
spend
time
reading
outside
materials
try
varian
he
puts
suggested
books
on
the
syllabus
for
a
reason
he's
not
the
greatest
teacher
but
you
don't
really
have
a
choice
-----
very
unorganized
but
interesting
class
very
little
homework
3
problem
sets
doesnt
really
matter
how
you
do
on
the
tests
and
problem
sets
because
he
gives
everyone
a
b+
unless
he
knows
who
you
are
and
he
likes
you
-----
extremely
interesting
class
material
is
well
presented
and
challenging
he
uses
good
examples
and
always
explains
the
intuition
behind
the
math
most
of
the
other
people
commenting
are
uh
lets
say
sissies
and
should
take
a
econ
principles
class
or
just
go
back
to
high
school
-----
he
can
not
teach
he
can
not
even
speak
does
not
even
reply
the
e-mails
you
can
not
learn
anything
from
the
lectures
he
is
not
prepared
at
all
-----
john
is
amazing
but
if
you
don't
have
a
good
ta
that's
going
to
work
against
you
he
puts
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
historical
context
over
literary
analysis
he's
usually
willing
to
allow
for
rewrites
and
retakes
on
midterms
-----
john
waters
is
certainly
the
best
professor
in
the
irish
department
this
class
is
challenging
but
provides
an
excellent
survey
of
irish
history
and
literature
he's
an
amazing
speaker
and
you
will
learn
so
much
take
the
time
to
do
the
readings
and
get
something
out
of
the
class
-----
john
is
the
best
professor
at
nyu
you
will
learn
so
much
he's
also
just
as
disillusioned
if
not
more
with
the
frustrations
of
bureaucratic
academia
as
any
student
so
he
gets
it
lectures
are
invigorating
and
completely
tireless
i
aspire
to
this
man's
success
and
integrity
-----
course
was
taught
by
2
profs
-
this
one
was
less
knowledgable
than
the
other
rambles
a
lot
during
lectures
on
things
not
relevant
to
the
reading
slow
in
giving
back
papers
and
assignments
makes
a
lot
of
non-pc
comments
w
o
realizing
-----
i
took
joyce
with
him
amazing
man
smart
knowledgeable
funny
and
insightful
i
could
listen
to
him
talk
about
joyce
for
hours
the
text
s
were
obviously
tough
and
he
empathised
with
our
pain;
the
class
is
not
for
the
weak
of
heart
one
small
thing
is
that
he
sometimes
has
trouble
returning
papers
on
time
all
in
all
great
guy
-----
phenomenal
professor
don't
let
the
tangential
lectures
deter
you
-----
very
knowledgeable
man
goes
off
on
tangents
for
most
of
class
i
usually
don't
know
what's
going
on
but
one
of
the
nicest
professors
i've
ever
had
really
cares
about
his
students
lots
of
reading
not
much
else
to
do
could
easily
fake
it
till
you
make
it
in
this
class
and
do
well
-----
waters
is
an
exceptional
intellectual
yes
he
can
be
vague
but
his
lectures
are
all
encompassing;
it
would
be
impossible
to
be
specific
ideas
and
sensations
chase
him
down
for
office
hours
once
you
meet
him
he
gives
full
attention
take
him
for
special
topics
courses
-
he's
fully
invested
highly
recommend
-----
amazing
lectures
you
will
do
well
in
this
class
as
long
as
you
do
the
reading
-----
he's
insanely
smart
but
his
lectures
are
all
over
the
place
he
tries
to
ask
a
ton
of
questions
so
that
you'll
think
about
what
you're
reading;
however
sometimes
it
leads
to
boredom
readings
and
tests
are
pretty
easy
-----
he
is
extremely
unorganized
the
class
is
basically
himself
talking
to
the
whole
class
for
80
minutes
without
any
notes
yeah
he
sounds
smart
right
but
you'll
have
a
hard
time
taking
notes
and
grasping
his
ideas
-----
i
took
a
map
ccc
class
with
waters
he
goes
off
on
tangents
during
lecture
and
they
are
hard
to
follow;
however
he
always
responds
to
emails
held
extra
office
hours
when
needed
started
a
discussion
group
since
we
did
not
have
recitation
and
slowed
the
pace
down
to
allow
discussion
no
work
except
reading
my
favorite
freshman
class
so
far
-----
he's
brilliant
but
he's
very
much
in
his
own
world
and
it's
hard
to
understand
exactly
what
he
means
to
say
he
is
bad
at
returning
emails
can
be
a
bit
disorganized
and
is
often
late
to
office
hours
but
i
did
very
well
on
the
midterm
though
i'm
not
sure
how
the
class
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
work
other
than
the
immense
amount
of
reading
-----
i
thought
that
this
would
an
interesting
class
as
the
other
comments
said
he
was
great
he
is
smart
but
he
rambles
and
goes
off
on
tangents
i
don't
understand
anything
that
happens
i
can't
wait
until
the
lecture
is
over
because
none
of
it
makes
sense
to
me
-----
you
will
have
no
idea
what
he
is
freakin
talking
about
-----
did
not
respond
to
emails
15
mins
late
to
every
class
and
made
us
stay
an
additional
15-20
mins
late
never
handed
back
papers
sometimes
posted
the
readings
for
the
class
the
day
of
brilliant
but
avoid
if
you
prefer
open
communication
and
organization
-----
after
a
horrble
experience
in
brit
lit
i
i
was
dreading
this
class
much
to
my
surprise
waters
made
the
class
engaging
and
fair
the
amount
of
writing
required
wasn't
too
steep
and
the
readings
were
enjoyable
and
easy
to
get
through
his
class
lectures
were
very
thorough
and
he
made
class
fun
and
interesting
-----
took
his
class
on
contemporary
irish
poetry
while
he's
a
great
guy
and
an
engaging
professor
he
is
totally
disorganized
most
of
what
we
read
was
photocopied
at
the
last
minute
because
he
never
ordered
the
books
so
it
was
hard
to
plan
ahead
and
an
unnecessary
hassle
to
get
the
books
elsewhere

her
class
even
if

-----
amy
really
cares
about
her
students
you
need
to
write
journals
before
every
class
so
you
can
discuss
them
in
class
the
readings
weren't
heavy
she
isn't
easy
when

don't
be

to
approach
her
with
questions
on
your
essay

she'll

that
you
care
about
your
writing
and
reward
you

it
she's
also
always
so
happy
during
each
class
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
in
her
class

i
was
actually
excited
to
go
to
her
classes
because
of
how
informative
yet
laid-back
her
classes
were
the
contents
in
class
are
never
ambiguous
or
needless-
they
were
all
interesting
to
discuss
with
the
class
however
her
grading
criteria
can
be
a
little
bit
ambiguous
so
clarify
with
her
if
you
need
to
take
her
class
it
was
a
great
one
-----
amy
is
incredibly
sweet
and
brings
in
so
many
interesting
viewpoints
on
writing
i
learned
so
much
from
her
class
and
she
was
always
there
if
i
needed
help
i
would
take
her
again
for
sure
-----
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
take
professor
wilkinson
do
it
she
chooses
the
most
interesting
readings
and
really
wants
students
to
engage
in
class
and
translate
that
to
their
writing
she
allows
so
much
freedom
with
essays
and
encourages
the
class
to
write
about
what
they're
passionate
about
highly
highly
recommend

she's
so
sweet
and
funny
and
extremely
helpful
i
always
look
forward
to

would
highly
recommend
her

amy
is
the
nicest
professor
i've
ever
takenshe
never
has
a
bad
dayand
always
comes
into
class
smiling
asking
how
everyone's
day
iseven
though
the
class
doesn't
answeri
thought
the
topic
of
food
was
weird
for
a
writing
classbut
it
turned
out
to
be
very
interestingthe
two
essays
are
long
12-15
pagesbut
you
get
plenty
of
time
to
work
on
them
-----
i
thought
this
was
a
great
introduction
to
writing
in
college
i
felt
like
i
learned
a
lot
about
different
writing
styles
and
i
felt
like
i
improved
my
own
writing
in
the
process
i
felt
a
bit
bad
though
because
hardly
everyone
would
participate
when
she
asked
questions
just
put
effort
in
the
essays
small
assignment;
it's
a
pretty
easy
class
-----
i
took
her
for
writing
1
she's
sweet
and
very
helpful
fair
grading
rewrite
allowed
but
i
think
she's
good
for
people
who
just
wanna
fulfill
the
requirements
since
her
class
was
a
bit
boring
and
honestly
i
don't
think
i've
learned
a
lot
-----
good
teacher
if
you
want
to
learn
about
food
and
writing
personally
i
was
not
interested
in
the
topic
which
made
the
work
seem
very
unnecessary
and
annoying
but
shes
a
very
helpful
teacher
and
grades
fair
-----
amy
can
make
wonders
when
it
comes
to
one's
ability
to
both
write
well
and
provoke
insightful
comments
in
their
essay
i
really
enjoyed
her
class
and
i
learned
so
much
from
food
cookery
she
took
a
bland
topic
and
turned
it
into
something
very
approachable
she
improved
my
writing
and
helped
me
see
another
perspective
loved
her
class
take
her
:
-----
amy
is
a
wonderful
professor
and
all
around
person
she
has
revolutionized
the
way
i
write
and
think
about
writing
and
she
has
made
a
class
and
a
topic
i
formerly
didn't
care
about
into
something
new
she
is
adorable
sweet
and
very
intelligent
she
recommends
some
good
books
authors
all
the
time
and
i
recommend
her
she's
clear
and
devoted
-----
i
absolutely
loved
her
as
a
professor
she's
so
sweet
we
wrote
a
couple
of
papers
and
she
allows
rewrites
which
are
due
at
the
end
of
the
semester
reading
load
can
be
a
lot
sometimes
but
overall
is
manageable
and
she
makes
you
keep
a
journal
i
really
wish
i
could've
taken
her
next
semester
definitely
take
her
if
you
can
-----
i
really
enjoy
professor
sondjaja's
class
hands
down
one
of
the
most
caring
professors
at
nyu
she
teaches
the
material
in
a
clear
structure
and
wants
you
to
succeed
go
to
office
hours
even
if
once
will
help
you
tremendously
everything
is
well-explained
in
a
way
that
i
don't
have
too
many
questions
to
ask
hope
i
can
take
more
of
her
classes
-----
tia
is
the
best
professor
i've
ever
had
in
the
math
department
100%
recommend
-----
tia
was
amazing
she
was
incredibly
passionate
which
made
her
lectures
very
engaging
she
was
also
able
to
break
down
some
of
the
more
complex
ideas
into
easily
understandable
steps
and
she
was
very
willing
to
answer
any
and
all
student
questions
and
always
phrased
her
answers
in
a
way
that
allowed
students
to
come
to
their
own
conclusions
-----
professor
sondjaja
is
a
very
nice
professor
that
gives
clear
lectures
and
has
tests
that
are
self-explanatory
-----
sondjaja
is
truly
someone
that
cares
about
the
learning
experience
she
will
do
whatever
she
can
to
help
a
person
understand
the
topic
and
enforces
participation
to
make
sure
everyone
is
on
the
same
page
she
does
not
mind
taking
time
after
class
to
talk
about
any
questions
-----
she's
incredible
discrete
isn't
easy
and
her
class
definitely
isn't
an
easy
a
but
she's
unbelievably
clear
and
logical
in
her
lectures
and
explanations
and
that's
very
important
for
a
class
like
discrete
you'll
really
really
learn
there's
a
fair
amount
of
homework
and
there
are
quizzes
every
week
but
those
are
all
pretty
easy
take
her
-----
sondjaja
is
an
amazing
professor
and
is
very
helpful
during
lectures
and
office
hours
and
really
makes
sure
all
students
understand
what
is
going
on
highly
recommend
any
of
her
classes
-----
great
professor
who
truly
tries
to
bring
her
best
every
lecture
presents
the
material
in
a
way
that
is
engaging
and
is
open
to
any
questions
hw
is
hard
and
lengthy
but
most
of
the
questions
are
repeats
from
previous
years
so
if
you
can
find
them
online
you'll
be
fine
exams
are
challenging
and
weigh
a
lot
on
your
grade
so
study
for
them
-----
shes
a
good
professor
she
will
make
sure
that
you
know
the
material
if
you
dont
understand
something
she
will
take
the
time
out
to
explain
it
to
you
in
a
different
way
discrete
math
is
a
cs
requirement
for
nyu
cas
i
didnt
like
the
material
nor
that
the
class
is
almost
2
hours
-----
sondjaja
is
a
very
nice
professor
she
teaches
a
tough
subject
and
she
tries
her
best
but
at
least
for
me
to
no
avail
her
test's
are
in
between
medium
and
hard
difficulty
average
score
for
first
test
was
80
and
second
test
was
in
the
70's
discrete
is
a
very
tough
subject
and
if
you
do
not
understand
it
then
good
luck
lots
of
people
retake
-----
amazing
professor
clear
explanations
but
difficult
material
and
curve
attendence

super
mandatory
but
if
you
want
to
get
better

an
okay
teacher

she

and
i
loved
it

are
hard
but
you
can
do
well
if
you
practice
the
weekly
worksheets
take
her
she
does
not
have
an
accent
so
you
would
be
able
to
understand
her
:
-----
she
is
the
best
she
is
the
most
caring
math
professor
and
really
cares
about
how
students

doing
and
integrates
how
students
are
reacting
to
the
material
into
her
lessons
she
slows

your
grade
as

-----
so
if
you
want
to
take
the
entertainment
media
intro
class
please
go
straight
to
peri
i
was
decided
to
just
get
over
with
the
requirement
but
this
class
ends
up
becoming
my
best
class
this
semester
peri
is
extremely
passionate
about
the
class
and
the
material
you
will
learn
a
lot
since
the
class
is
really
systematic
-----
professor
shamsai
is
the
best
i've
never
taken
a
marketing
stern
course
before
and
it
was
definitely
challenging
but
at
the
same
time
i
learned
so
much
that
is
so
applicable
to
all
your
other
classes
in
bemt
minor
i
didn't
participate
much
which
shattered
my
grade
the
class
is
tough
but
so
rewarding
definitely
keep
in
touch
with
peri
-----
peri
is
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
had
at
nyu
i'm
not
a
business
person
but
she
struck
a
perfect
balance
between
simplifying
concepts
and
respecting
students'
intelligence
she
knows
the
industry
side
of
things
backwards
and
forwards
and
is
full
of
stories
that
are
both
entertaining
and
informative
plus
she's
super
nice
-----
emi
is
a
very
helpful
course
since
it
gives
you
an
overview
of
all
the
entertainment
industries
professor
shamsai
does
a
great
job
of
teaching
this
course
she
is
passionate
about
the
subject
and
has
so
much
amazing
experience
in
entertainment
industries
that
she's
more
than
happy
to
share
she
is
also
always
willing
to
answer
questions
and
help
-----
this
class
is
required
for
the
bemt
minor
and
if
you're
looking
for
a
professor
that
will
really
make
the
material
digestible
for
you
it's
peri
there
is
not
much
outside
work
for
the
class
so
attending
the
lectures
is
pretty
important
she
is
such
a
sweet
person
and
is
more
than
willing
to
hop
on
the
phone
with
you
at
any
point
to
help
-----
three
years
post
grad
and
i
still
implement
the
lessons
learned
from
peri's
lectures
regardless
of
my
artistic
academic
background
i
was
forced
to
think
of
myself
not
only
as
a
part
of
this
industry
but
challenged
to
be
a
game
changer
take
this
class
the
longterm
value
outweighs
the
amount
of
credits
on
your
transcript
-----
prof
shamsai's
class
was
exceptionally
helpful
in
preparing
me
both
for
other
courses
in
bemt
at
nyu
as
well
as
for
working
in
the
entertainment
industry
in
my
other
internships
the
class
work
is
very
manageable
with
an
emphasis
on
group
work
prof
shamsai
is
very
knowledgeable
and
her
passion
makes
the
lectures
fun
and
engaging
-----
prof
shamsai
is
incredibly
knowledgeable
and
cares
a
lot
about
the
class
learning
the
fundamentals
of
the
media
&
entertainment
industries
the
learnings
are
very
practical
and
have
helped
me
in
internship
interviews
and
work
this
is
a
terrific
class
if
you
really
want
to
understand
the
media
industries
-----
she's
passionate
about
the
topic
but
she
asks
for
way
too
much
from
a
2
credit
class
asking
for
a
midterm
a
final
and
a
presentation
is
just
too
much
plus
she
asks
you
to
call
in
twice
for
the
group
project
and
the
amount
of
work
she
expects
is
too
much
-----
prof
shamsai's
emi
class
was
one
of
my
favorite
courses
at
nyu
shamsai
is
incredibly
knowledgable
and
made
lectures
both
interesting
and
entertaining
the
course
is
a
very
detailed
but
clear
overview
of
m&e
industries
projects
&
workload
were
totally
manageable
and
tests
were
very
fair
overall
a
great
class
and
a
fun
and
helpful
professor
-----
has
a
lot
of
passion
for
the
subject
but
that's
about
it
throws
a
lot
of
information
at
you
it's
hard
to
take
notes
and
the
tests
are
incredibly
difficult
even
if
you
understand
the
material
and
put
a
reasonable
amount
of
studying
team
in
also
have
to
do
a
7-person
group
project
overall
not
a
fan
of
the
class
and
would
not
recommend
-----
i
have
never
used
rmp
before
but
after
completing
peri's
emi
i
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
this
course
was
the
most
practical
course
that
i
have
taken
thus
far
at
nyu
and
that
being
said
there
was
never
a
dull
moment
ps
is
extremely
passionate
engaging
kind
supportive
and
tons
of
fun
she
helps
you
build
your
future
and
she
truly
cares
-----
professor
shamsai
had
her
for
media
&
entertainment
industries
in
stern
was
one
of
the
best
educators
i've
ever
had
she
is
very
passionate
about
the
material
explains
concepts
clearly
and
genuinely
wants
her
students
to
succeed
she
expects
high
engagement
and
is
very
inspirational
in
doing
so
i
can't
recommend
her
enough
-----
great
class
really
informative
compared
to
how
much
this
class
teaches
you
about
media
its
not
hard
at
all
and
def
worth
it
professor
did
a
great
job
bringing
real
world
examples
to
the
class
texts
-----
shamsai
did
a
great
job
teaching
the
key
aspects
of
m&e
industries
if
you
want
to
gain
a
good
understanding
of
these
industries
this
is
a
great
class
it's
not
easy
but
shamsai
ensure
all
students
have
the
background
they
need;
she
is
always
available
for
exam
prep
&
help
on
team
projects
i
now
work
in
media
&
use
learnings
from
the
class
often
-----
this
class
is
not
easy
especially
if
you're
like
me
and
don't
have
a
big
business
background
however
prof
shamsai
does
a
great
job
of
breaking
down
the
econ
sections
i
came
away
from
the
semester
with
a
great
understanding
of
the
broader
entertainment
industry
it's
a
lot
to
cover
in
one
semester
and
she
understands
which
info
is
most
useful
-----
it
was
definitely
not
an
easy
class
to
do
well
in
but
professor
shamsai
is
very
fair
she
is
very
knowledgable
of
the
industry
and
makes
herself
very
available
to
her
students
the
final
project
was
meaningful
and
helped
me
to
learn
more
about
the
current
state
of
the
entertainment
industry
make
sure
to
memorize
every
last
detail
on
those
ppts
-----
she
was
my
professor
for
media
and
entertainment
i
think
she
did
an
excellent
job
covering
the
basics
of
the
different
areas
of
the
entertainment
industry
her
lectures
were
well
organized
if
you
read
the
case
studies
and
pay
attention
in
lecture
you'll
have
no
problem
this
is
a
great
class
if
you're
serious
about
the
entertainment
industry
-----
he
is
a
sweet
person
likes
his
students
and
enjoys
teaching
but
it
is
just
so
hard
to
understand
his
concept
and
ideas
he
often
repeats
lessons
people
seem
bored
during
the
class
he
really
gets
pissed
when
people
are
not
paying
attention
or
sleeping
so
pay
attention
and
participate
-----
he's
a
sweet
guy
and
super
enthusiastic
but
i
really
think
he
has
no
clue
what
he's
talking
about
sometimes
-----
i
had
him
for
the
summer
session
he
is
a
really
sweet
guy
and
a
good
teacher
if
you
listen
yes
he
can
be
confusing
but
he
clears
things
up
if
you
go
to
see
him
during
office
hours
people
do
not
like
this
class
because
you
actually
have
to
work
for
your
grade
-----
i
really
liked
him
he's
a
fun
and
nice
guy
also
he
knows
quality
writing
very
well
good
guy
not
the
easiest
class
in
the
world
but
one
of
my
favorites
-----
this
was
the
worst
class
i've
had
to
take
so
far
it
was
boring
and
hard
and
he's
useless
as
far
as
help
-----
very
energetic
in
the
morninglikes
to
send
emails
before
8:00
am
on
the
weekends
kind
of
vague
in
his
helpfulness
woka
wokawoka
woka
right
-----
loves
to
talk
but
can
be
vague
with
his
statements
very
enthusiastic
for
an
early
morning
class
biased
but
if
you
follow
his
suggestions
you'll
receive
a
better
grade
right
waka
waka
waka
-----
a
difficult
yet
fun
professor
he
is
a
bit
of
an
oddball
but
he
absolutely
loves
literature
and
writing
just
put
in
effort
and
it
will
pay
off
-----
do
not
take
this
sorry
excuse
for
a
professor
if
you
wish
to
enjoy
your
life
this
man
is
a
soul
crusher
dream
ender
and
life
ruiner
over
15
hours
of
work
on
my
essay
earned
me
an
average
grade
he
is
an
unfair
grader
and
a
biased
prick
who
only
values
his
own
pitiful
opinions
stay
away
from
this
man
if
you
want
to
improve
your
writing
-----
he's
absolutely
useless
a
very
biased
grader
he
is
cryptic
in
his
desires
and
vague
with
his
criticisms
he
makes
connections
so
obscure
even
a
philosophy
professor
got
confused
take
the
class
at
your
own
risk
-----
prof
mccormack
was
really
helpful
and
insightful
in
class
having
class
with
him
was
a
really
enjoyable
way
for
me
to
start
my
day
he
is
admittedly
a
difficult
professor
but
i
have
learned
much
from
him
i
feel
that
most
people
don't
put
in
that
much
effort
which
they
blame
him
for
and
that's
not
fair
i
loved
him
and
recommend
him
to
all
-----
loved
writing
before
attending
this
class
my
fall
semester
of
freshman
year
learned
nothing
and
did
not
improve
but
not
for
lack
of
effort
all
three
essays
received
the
same
grade
although
i
did
well
in
discussions
and
minor
assignments
biased
grader
looks
only
for
his
opinions
-
write
what
he
wants
and
you'll
get
an
a
-----
definitely
wants
his
students
to
feel
as
passionately
towards
the
subject
as
he
does
but
falls
very
short
not
to
mention
his
advice
is
the
most
cryptic
crap
i've
ever
heard--
when
asking
about
my
essay
the
only
thing
he
could
advise
me
to
do
was
to
let
the
essayists
be
the
string
of
popcorn
on
my
magical
christmas
tree
of
an
essay
thanks
-----
we
get
to
see
a
strange
polish
movie
in
class
mccormack
also
makes
some
loose
vague
connections
between
various
texts
but
he
is
certainly
encouraging
enthusiastic
and
he
works
hard
to
get
us
engaged
in
the
material
as
well
he's
humorous
at
times
too;
serious
when
he
has
to
be
though
i
suggest
take
this
course
makes
you
think
a
lot:
-----
totally
a
nice
guy
really
eager
to
help
might
confuse
you
sometimes
but
if
you're
really
persistent
he
can
actually
be
helpful
in
office
hours
be
on
time
to
his
class
he
pretends
nt
2
care
but
totally
marks
u
down
4
it
most
enthusiastic
person
i've
eber
met
grades
really
harshly
-----
extremely
nice
guy
he's
really
enthusiastic
about
everything
he
wants
us
to
share
in
his
enthusiasm
as
well
i
feel
like
he
lacks
the
ability
to
truly
guide
us
he
is
a
bit
cryptic
i
wish
he
had
been
more
concrete
about
his
advice
insight
i
felt
lost
and
he
was
never
there
to
really
help
at
all
i
don't
feel
like
i
improved
or
learned
much
-----
he
wants
to
inspire
his
students
to
write
but
he
just
can't
a
lot
of
writing
for
his
class
a
lot
of
reading
and
he
is
a
harsh
grader
his
classes
are
boring
but
he's
a
nice
guy
-----
no
comments
-----
enthusiastic
and
good-hearted
not
the
greatest
listener
but
if
you
go
to
his
office
hours
and
calm
him
down
he
can
be
a
good
help
if
you
aren't
enthusiastic
about
writing
i
think
you'll
have
problems
but
if
you're
interested
in
improving
he
can
be
a
great
help
despite
some
bs
now
and
then
he's
quite
an
intelligent
professor
-----
this
teacher
if
you
can
call
him
that
is
the
biggest
piece
of
crap
in
the
world
i
have
had
more
intelligent
conversations
with
coma
patients
than
with
him
he
is
by
far
the
worst
teacher
i
have
ever
had
not
helpful
not
fair
and
a
total
****
to
top
it
off
he
is
worse
than
malignant
brain
tumors
stay
away
-----
dr
fenton
is
a
super
nice
guy
who's
willing
to
hear
you
out
on
things
he
always
wants
his
students
to
do
well
the
class
is
pretty
difficult
for
a
core
class
but
you
really
don't
need
to
memorize
anything
to
do
well
on
the
exams
he
makes
the
exams
about
broader
concepts
and
you
should
be
able
to
do
well
if
you
can
think
logically
-----
very
smart
professor
and
a
nice
guy
class
is
a
little
tough
for
a
core
subject
-----
this
class
is
dense
with
complicated
material
but
professor
fenton
works
hard
to
break
everything
down
for
students
he
really
wants
to
see
everyone
learn
and
pass
there's
a
generous
curve
throughout
the
semester
and
he
loves
having
students
ask
questions
after
class
or
during
office
hours
if
you're
struggling
seek
him
out
-----
don't
make
the
mistake
i
did
and
think
this
class
will
be
half
bio
and
half
psych
it
is
absolutely
pure
bio
the
name
of
the
class
is
misleading
he
is
primarily
used
to
teaching
graduate
students
and
therefore
teaches
a
lot
of
complex
material
for
undergrads
he
is
horrible
at
explaining
stuff
and
his
office
hours
are
useless
don't
take
him
-----
dr
fenton
doesn't
even
teach
from
the
book
he
teaches
based
off
of
research
he's
done
but
since
the
research
he's
done
is
a
very
specific
part
of
memory
expect
the
final
to
go
way
too
in
depth
into
his
one
topic
while
not
really
covering
other
things
unbelievably
hard
tests
unbelievably
condescending
and
despite
what
he
lets
on
no
curve
-----
for
a
guy
that
has
to
teach
students
about
complicated
bodily
structures
he
does
a
good
job
his
lectures
can
be
a
bit
dull
simply
because
the
material
is
complex
and
sometimes
hard
to
picture
but
he
mixes
in
some
jokes
and
good
analogies
here
and
there
to
keep
students
attentive
he's
also
very
welcoming
and
really
wants
to
see
you
succeed
-----
read
the
textbook
before
the
lecture
then
do
the
lab
in
recitation
and
you
should
absorb
the
material
well
otherwise
it
is
very
dense
and
there
will
be
a
lot
to
cram
for
each
exam
as
long
as
you
stay
up
to
date
you
should
be
fine
for
the
pop
quizzes
as
well
material
is
somewhat
interesting
but
he
does
a
decent
job
presenting
it
-----
prof
fenton
is
very
funny
and
he
knows
how
to
make
the
classes
concentrated
on
his
topic
he
is
very
helpful
in
learning
his
explanation
is
the
best
i've
honestly
ever
seen
among
neuroscience
dept
-----
attendance
was
not
mandatory
and
i
did
not
go
to
class
except
for
a
handful
of
times
go
to
lab
do
most
of
the
readings
actually
watch
the
short
online
materials
find
someone
to
study
with
and
ask
your
ta
questions
and
it's
an
easy
a
if
you
go
to
lecture
and
you
can't
pull
at
least
a
b+
then
there's
something
wrong
with
you
-----
professor
fenton
is
a
very
bright
man
who
clearly
knows
a
lot
about
the
field
of
neuroscience
when
i
would
go
in
for
tutoring
the
students
would
tell
me
that
this
class
is
basically
a
simplified
intro
to
neuroscience
this
class
was
difficult
but
overall
if
you
read
the
book
you
will
do
fine
on
the
midterm
and
the
final
-----
andre
is
so
passionate
about
what
he
is
teaching
and
wants
to
ignite
a
passion
for
the
same
subject
within
all
of
his
students
he
is
a
fast
and
straightforward
lecturer
ready
to
answer
all
questions
if
you're
willing
to
ask
them
in
lecture
his
tests
are
easy
but
if
you
pay
attention
and
engage
in
the
subject
the
tests
will
be
okay
-----
the
teacher
doesn't
explain
the
concepts
very
well
in
class
so
be
prepared
to
rely
on
the
textbook
for
most
of
the
answers
pop
quizzes
happen
often
and
are
quite
difficult
-----
i
found
his
lectures
to
be
too
abstract
and
unclear
he
will
give
out
an
occasional
pop
quiz
when
he
sees
there's
not
many
people
attending
class
his
tests
are
a
bit
more
on
the
difficult
side
he
gave
us
the
option
to
drop
our
2nd
midterm
and
have
final
count
for
more
so
that
was
nice
passionate
for
what
he
does
he
just
isn't
the
best
teacher
-----
don't
take
this
class
core
science
classes
are
for
students
who
don't
have
an
interest
in
science
this
class
was
way
too
difficult
for
a
core
class
and
the
professor
just
doesn't
know
how
to
teach
he's
very
smart
but
not
good
at
conveying
information
-----
if
you're
not
afraid
of
a
challenge
and
are
willing
to
study
take
this
class
it
seriously
changed
by
life
and
the
way
i
think
about
everything
professor
fenton
is
a
really
nice
guy
and
clearly
has
passion
about
his
area
of
study
-----
i
really
enjoyed
this
class
it
does
require
a
lot
of
work
especially
for
a
non-science
major
i
was
not
a
science
person
in
high
school
but
loved
learning
about
neuroscience
in
fenton's
class
if
you
are
interested
and
willing
to
do
the
textbook
reading
then
take
this
class
-----
originally
i
thought
this
class
was
going
to
be
more
psychology
based
unfortunately
it's
heavy
on
the
biology
i
was
never
good
at
science
so
i
was
very
scared
i
just
took
the
final
and
don't
even
remember
a
thing
honestly
i
suggest
taking
another
nat
sci
i
feel
rewarded
after
studying
hard
but
this
class
is
a
challenge
-----
this
is
by
far
the
most
difficult
class
i've
taken
as
a
non-science
major
at
nyu
so
much
reading
this
class
is
less
about
behavior
and
is
more
an
intro
to
neuroscience
the
tests
are
ridiculously
hard
and
i
found
myself
miserable
and
studying
much
more
for
this
class
than
any
of
my
others
labs
have
nothing
to
do
with
lectures
don't
take
this
-----
worst
course
and
worst
teacher
puts
a
damper
on
your
gpa
the
resources
provided
are
useless
-
just
slides
with
pictures
and
no
words
on
them
he
claims
that
he
does
not
want
you
to
memorize
the
material
but
you
basically
need
to
know
the
whole
500
page
textbook
by-heart
if
you
want
to
pass
prof
was
condescending
and
unhelpful
-----
this
class
was
more
about
the
chemical
processes
of
the
brain
than
the
relationship
between
the
brain
and
behavior
andre
attempted
to
be
a
good
prof
but
was
unclear
in
class
and
condescending
in
office
hours
the
tests
were
hard
the
tas
were
alright
but
the
labs
were
terrible
avoid
this
class
if
possible
-----
great
class
not
much
reading
or
homework
but
the
tests
do
cover
a
lot
of
information
get
ready
to
memorize
bone
names
still
i
would
recommend
forensic
anthropology
to
anyone
its
very
interesting
and
difficult
but
not
ridiculous
-----
lots
of
info
and
memorization
but
the
class
is
very
interesting
-----
prof
anton
is
amazing
she
is
a
woman
who
knows
what
she
is
talking
about
and
while
at
times
the
material
can
be
frustrating
like
memorizing
every
infra-order
and
sub-family
of
the
order
primates
i
enjoyed
every
second
of
the
lectures
she
gave
exams
were
tough
but
she
curves
really
nicely
and
as
long
as
you
exert
some
effort
you're
good
-----
do
not
take
thsi
class
for
core
credit
there
is
alot
of
information
and
three
really
and
unnecessarily
hard
tests
if
you
are
going
to
be
a
anthro
major
than
fine
you'll
learn
a
lot
and
she
preps
you
well
for
your
industry
but
this
won't
be
a
gpa
booster
unless
you
have
lots
of
time
to
study
-----
brilliant
professorbest
lecturer
i
had
at
nyu
i
was
pretty
resentful
about
the
amount
of
memorization
and
tedious
laboratory
work
but
taking
the
material
we
learned
changed
the
way
i
thought
about
the
world
can't
ask
for
much
more
than
that
-----
excellent
professor
extremely
difficult
class
she
expects
you
to
memorize
every
detail
for
the
exam
if
you're
not
an
anthropology
major
there
is
absolutely
no
need
or
reason
for
you
have
to
memorize
every
single
primate
species
but
she's
an
awesome
person
and
professor
and
really
funny
-----
i
cannot
fathom
how
a
professor
expects
students
at
the
undergraduate
level
to
retain
so
much
information
professor
anton
is
a
great
professor
who
knows
the
material
well
but
her
exams
are
very
difficult
expect
to
memorize
1000
details
and
then
only
be
tested
on
10
-----
prof
anton
is
an
awesome
lecturer
and
makes
the
information
seem
really
clear
but
the
exams
are
a
different
story
as
long
as
you
know
that
they
will
be
a
lot
harder
and
more
detailed
than
the
lectures
make
it
seem
youll
be
fine
labs
are
mandatory
and
tedious
-----
dr
anton
is
the
reason
i
decided
to
double
in
anthro
her
classes
are
definitely
tough
because
of
all
the
material
but
she's
willing
to
work
with
you
to
make
sure
you
understand
it
all
she
makes
the
class
interesting
and
her
expectations
are
pretty
straightforward
no
surprises
here
-----
she's
an
amazing
professor
for
human
evolution
i
learned
a
lot
and
had
a
lot
of
fun
dr
anton
is
extremely
approachable
and
funny
the
labs
are
kind
of
hard
and
there
is
a
lot
of
information
covered
but
if
you
have
good
memorization
skills
you'll
do
just
fine
-----
i
didn't
expect
there
to
be
so
much
information
be
prepared
to
memorize
the
characteristics
of
20+
species
the
labs
are
also
quite
difficult
the
tests
were
however
fair
professor
anton
is
very
passionate
about
her
subject
and
i
feel
lucky
to
have
had
her
as
a
professor
just
get
ready
to
memorize
memorize
memorize
-----
awesome
teacher
great
class
to
take
for
the
required
natural
science
class
i
have
never
taken
anthropology
and
she
is
a
great
teacher
and
the
tas
are
awesome
-----
i
was
excited
to
take
this
course
based
on
previous
reviews
despite
doing
well
i
thoroughly
regret
taking
it
the
material
was
significantly
more
in
depth
than
i
had
expected
for
an
entry
level
class
and
the
professor
simply
did
not
help
to
make
it
clear
or
interesting
if
you
are
looking
to
fulfill
your
nat
sci
requirement
choose
another
class
-----
forensic
anthropology
best
professor
ever
funny
clearly
smart
engaging
learned
a
ton
you
need
to
definitely
study
hard
but
the
material
is
so
interesting
it
won't
matter
-----
awesome
professor
her
human
evolution
class
is
the
reason
i
took
on
a
double
major
in
anthro
currently
taking
her
forensic
anthro
class
she's
funny
engaging
and
the
reading
she
assigns
isn't
overwhelming
her
exams
are
tough
but
i
never
feel
unprepared
definitely
take
a
class
with
her
if
you
can
-----
i
took
her
for
intro
to
forensic
anthro
and
for
human
evolution
brilliant
funny
engaging
understands
students
and
our
needs
-
powerpoints
up
right
after
lectures
puts
up
sample
tests
before

lectures
are
straightforward
-
she
is
the
perfect
professor
i
love
her
you
will
not
regret
taking
her
class
-----
by
far
the
best
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
-
professor
anton
is
the
reason
i
changed
my
major
to
anthropology
she
is
a
funny
and
engaging
speaker
and
made
every
lecture
fascinating
the
exams
were
easy
if
you
studied
can't
wait
to
take
another
class
with
her

i
took
her
for

made
the

amazingly
cool

she
is
an
excellent

this
was
the
first
anthropology
class
i
ever
took
and
it
made
me
change
my
major
to
anthropology
she
is
funny
intelligent
nice
and
helpful
an
overall
very
good
teacher
even
with

very

&
great
prof
take
this
class
-----
hands
down
the
coolest
class
i
took
at
nyu
i
cannot
even
say
how
awesome
i
thought
this
class
was
the
only
problem
was
that
it
was
really
hard-
but
totally
worth
it
-----
fred
myers
is
extremely
arrogant
and
self-absorbed
lectures
were
spent
just
talking
about
himself
and
showing
pictures
of
him
in
australia
most
readings
were
his
own
books
so
he
would
be
personally
offended
if
you
didn't
read
them
and
agree
with
everything
ta
will
make
or
break
your
grade
class
is
so
boring
take
a
different
c&c
-----
a
good
choice
for
core
culture
requirement
experience
depends
heavily
on
ta
there
are
4
four
page
papers
and
almost
all
the
reading
is
fairly
dry
class
itself
is
pretty
laid
back
and
you
don't
have
to
go
to
every
lecture
-----
fred
is
a
pretty
floaty
loose
lecturer
which
can
be
frustrating
in
a
course
without
much
structure
without
a
good
ta
this
class
can
be
a
real
thorn
in
your
behind
but
with
one
it's
pretty
breezy
the
entire
class
is
graded
on
4
papers
so
beware
your
gpa
if
you
muck
one
up
relatively
interesting
class
as
an
australian
but
can
be
boring
-----
fred
myers
is
very
passionate
about
what
he
is
teaching
and
quick
to
include
his
own
anecdotal
experience
of
australia
be
ready
to
read
the
books
he
assigns
all
but
one
of
which
are
dry
because
the
essays
are
based
on
lecture
and
the
books
recitation
will
help
you
understand
lectures
better
i'm
glad
i
took
the
class
and
i
learned
a
lot
-----
without
a
doubt
professor
myers
is
hands
down
one
of
the
chillest
professors
out
there
his
lectures
are
empowering
and
insightful
although
he
can
be
a
little
dry
sometimes
his
experience
and
knowledge
of
aboriginal
australia
is
simply
stunning
it
also
boils
down
to
a
large
degree
your
ta
but
if
you
participate
everything
will
turn
out
okay
-----
i
took
his
core
indigenous
australia
course
the
readings
were
easy
to
engage
with
and
the
papers
mostly
focused
on
the
readings
and
films
so
lecture
attendance
didn't
really
matter
he
is
a
really
nice
guy
and
the
course
is
very
effective
what
grade
you
get
is
totally
up
to
your
ta
though
-----
this
class
is
one
of
the
easiest
cultures
and
contexts
you'll
find
while
i'm
not
very
interested
in
the
topic
the
prof
is
and
he
is
super
knowledgable
i
often
felt
bad
for
him
because
many
people
did
not
respect
him
but
he's
really
sweet
he
also
doesn't
have
any
midterms
or
finals
the
overall
grade
is
based
on
the
four
essays
-----
what
makes
this
class
is
the
ta
you
get
the
recitations
and
ta
office
hours
always
answered
the
papers
for
me
the
actual
professor
is
a
nice
guy
and
really
wants
you
to
learn
about
his
passion
but
his
lectures
can
be
dry
and
there
is
a
crazy
amount
of
reading
-
only
a
third
of
which
you
actually
need
for
the
papers
easy
a
if
you
put
in
effort
-----
every
essay
is
graded
by
your
ta
and
if
you
have
a
tough
one
this
class
will
not
be
a
cake
walk
don't
take
this
class
unless
you're
feeling
lucky
and
get
the
reasonable
and
good
ta
which
is
rare
avoid
this
class
if
you
want
a
good
grade
even
if
you
work
hard
and
put
in
the
effort
like
i
did
if
your
ta
is
tough
none
of
that
matters
avoid
-----
gives
a
2-question
pop
quiz
from
time
to
time
graded
on
completion
i
think
basic
stuff
but
it
means
you
have
to
show
up
class
is
an
insane
cake
walk
3
papers
and
you
don't
really
have
to
do
the
reading
week-to-week
but
your
papers
are
based
on
it
and
it's
too
dense
to
skim
last
minute
lectures
are
crazy
boring
but
you'll
get
a
good
grade
-----
talks
about
himself
a
lot
and
all
the
things
he's
done
with
the
pintupi
and
how
many
friends
he
has
down
under
the
essays
are
annoying
because
tas
are
not
helpful
with
them
at
all
they
are
vengeful
so
beware
and
get
on
their
good
side
-----
indigenous
australia
with
him
is
not
the
most
interesting
or
helpful
course
but
it
is
an
easy
course
with
just
a
bit
of
interest
and
participation
you
will
do
well
in
his
classes
even
though
learning
about
australian
aborigines
is
not
the
most
interesting
topic
i
like
listening
to
his
lectures
-----
this
class
is
a
piece
of
cake
i
am
actually
sitting
in
class
now
you
can
sit
on
your
computer
if
you
even
decide
to
go
to
class
no
midterm
no
final
just
3
papers
i
couldn't
have
been
happier
to
take
this
class
it
teaches
you
nothing
but
it's
easy
-----
interesting
sort
of
for
a
week
then
he
repeats
himself
for
the
rest
of
the
term
half
of
the
class
was
asleep
the
other
half
wasn't
there
three
essays
and
no
tests
tas
had
no
idea
what
to
talk
about
total
waste
of
time
-----
professor
myers
is
genuinely
interested
in
what
he
is
teaching
he
tends
to
go
off
on
tangents
but
go
into
the
class
with
the
right
attitude
and
interest
and
you
will
do
well
and
learn
a
lot
-----
professor
myers
is
straightforward
and
very
fair
in
his
grading
exactly
what
is
needed
in
a
map
course--
overall
very
enjoyable
-----
arrogant
and
annoying
told
the
same
stories
every
lecture
good
thing
was
that
there
were
four
essays
and
one
was
optional
no
tests
boring
reading
though
-----
i
took
world
cultures
australia
with
him
as
my
professor
and
it
could
have
been
much
more
interesting
he
is
kinda
intimadating
and
many
of
us
were
afraid
to
ask
questions
the
good
part
about
his
class
is
that
i
didn't
have
find
it
necessary
to
do
the
readings
and
there
were
only
3
papers
and
the
final
was
optional
-----
intro
to
aboriginal
culture
class
awful
but
no
need
to
go
to
lecture
tas
good
-----
no
comments
-----
very
knowledgeable
speaks
clearly
funny
at
times
good
at
describing
the
harder
concepts
tests
are
fair
quiz
every
class
very
easy
based
off
previous
class
means
attendance
is
mandatory
but
you
can
just
walk
out
after
if
you
have
to
but
i
wouldn't
recommend
it
don't
sleep
on
this
pepsi-drinking
lumberjack
-----
dies
is
a
very
solid
teacher
he's
difficult
but
it
seems
appropriate
given
the
class
very
good
lecturer
who
can
explain
confusing
topics
with
precision
and
care
caring
the
daily
quizzes
are
good
to
keep
you
on
track
and
can
boost
your
grade
show
up
to
class
read
the
book
if
you
don't
it's
a
good
book
and
you're
in
good
shape
recommend
-----
he
is
the
best
professor
ever
work
hard
and
you
will
get
an
a
if
you
are
struggling
he
will
do
his
best
to
give
you
a
respectable
grade
he
genuinely
wants
to
see
everyone
move
on
to
the
next
course
he
is
the
best
person
i
ever
met
-----
go
to
class
but
his
lectures
aren't
great
if
you
aren't
the
best
at
calc
or
visualizing
math
he
mostly
just
goes
through
examples
from
the
book
i
needed
a
lot
of
extra
help
understanding
concepts
i
struggled
in
his
class
but
he
is
very
kind
not
an
l
if
you
get
him
but
there
are
probably
better
options
-----
he's
a
good
lecturer
clear
and
concise
and
willing
to
help
with
problems
he
tries
his
best
to
make
you
understand
why
things
work
the
way
they
do
exam
was
easier
than
the
midterm
and
he
curves
everyone
below
a
certain
grade
solid
teacher
would
take
again
for
future
math
classes
-----
pretty
fair
tests
although
i've
heard
he's
harder
than
other
professors
for
discrete
was
rough
for
an
8am
but
make
the
effort
to
go
to
classes
and
he'll
reward
you
gave
a
random
pop
quiz
that
was
to
write
your
favorite
number
down
would
take
again
very
clear
and
great
clear
voice
-----
good
lecture
but
he
makes
the
homework
harder
than
other
instructor
as
far
as
i
know
other
two
sections
doesn't
have
that
much
homework
nor
hard
exam
-----
took
it
over
the
summer
and
he
had
no
office
hours
unclear
grading
criteria
but
nbd
would
take
again
if
he
has
office
hours
-----
very
interesting
and
clear
teacher
helped
me
break
down
my
assignments
into
simple
logical
progressions
respects
his
students
-----
he
is
a
great
teacher
his
lectures
are
very
clear
cut
and
really
knows
his
material
and
how
to
explain
it
always
there
to
help
tests
are
pretty
standard
great
teacher
i
recommend
-----
i
took
it
over
the
summer
and
he
had
no
office
hours
-----
uses
real
examples
in
homework
requires
programming
not
in
course
description
in
syllabus
though
-----
fair
not
great
teach
from
the
book
but
give
inspiring
homework
good
voice

his
lectures
are
very
helpful
he

a
very
great

me
towards
an

-----
dies
is
an
overall
great
professor
he
has
a
great
sense
of
humor

erik
is
hands
down
the
best
lecturer
you
can
possibly
have
for
a
math
class
he
begins
each
class
with
an
organized
concise
review
of
the
previous
class
he
is
very
approachable
if
you're
missing
a
concept
and
he
gives
very
strong
hints
as
to
what
he'll
put
on
the
exam
he
makes
hard
math
subjects
bearable
-----
erik
is
a
fantastic
communicator
who
likes
to
do
mini
review
sessions
of
prior
material
at
the
start
of
each
class
this
is
helpful
come
exam
time
as
well
as
for
quiz
preparation
his
midterm
was
very
easy
as
was
his
final
exam
do
all
the
hws
and
ace
one
of
the
two
exams
and
you'll
receive
an

-----
great
lecturer
took
him
for
calculus
2
he
really
made
the
topics
we
covered
clear
always
open
to
questions
from
students
and
speaks
clear
english
which
is
definitely
important
for
a
math
class
take
him
if
you

aviva's
class
on
civil
rights
has
changed
my
life
i
don't
understand
her
less
than
amazing
reviews
on
here
she
outlines
what
is
expected
of
you
on
the
first
day
of
class
she
really
cares
about
her
students
meet
with
her
for
office
hours
so
she
is
familiar
with
who
you
are
i
wish
i
could
go
back
in
time
i
would
have
taken
all
of
her
classes
-----
aviva
is
a
very
kind
woman
who
is
passionate
and
extremely
knowledgable
about
all
things
documentary
she
loves
to
hear
from
students
and
is
a
very
easy
grader
when
it
comes
to
papers--
she
mostly
just
wants
to
see
your
thoughts
-----
very
engaged
kind
and
a
generous
teacher
willing
to
meet
outside
of
class
hours
and
discuss
current
projects
creative
talented
and
overwhelmingly
great
teacher
-----
aviva
is
a
fantastic
teacher
and
listener
she's
highly
engaged
with
her
students
and
has
a
great
taste
in
documentary
films
she
is
very
knowledgable
about
her
craft
and
is
a
fantastic
educator
-----
i've
taken
two
classes
with
aviva
and
have
loved
both
she
is
a
great
person
and
a
great
teacher
you
will
get
a
lot
out
of
her
classes
if
you
are
willing
to
show
up
pay
attention
and
do
the
work
she
does
not
assign
busy
work
she
wants
her
students
to
enjoy
the
class
and
to
do
well
she
expects
you
to
put
forth
your
best
effort
-----
amazing
teacher
some
sort
of
writing
assignment
every
week
but
the
amount
learned
in
and
out
of
class
is
awesome
she
has
incredible
industry
and
academic
experience
and
her
ideas
and
quotes
are
inspirational
eye
opening
class
-----
aviva
is
a
great
teacher
attendance
is
mandatory
you're
allowed
to
miss
two
classes
and
you'll
have
homework
almost
every
week
but
there
are
no
tests
every
writing
assignment
is
simply
a
chance
for
you
to
form
your
own
thoughts
on
the
subject
as
long
as
you're
invested
and
bring
ideas
to
the
table
you'll
do
well
would
take
again
-----
extremely
knowledgeable
about
the
subject
and
always
brought
in
great
guests
films
to
share
with
the
class
she's
always
eager
to
share
her
thoughts
with
hopeful
filmmakers
if
you
ask
to
meet
with
her
the
weekly
assignments
aren't
painful
but
they
can
be
annoying
all
in
all
great
lady
great
class
-----
master
class
doc
i
love
aviva
i'll
admit
her
personality
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
she's
pretty
fair
she
only
asks
that
you
not
be
late
and
care
about
the
subject
i
did
well
in
her
class
because
i
did
the
work
and
it
wasn't
that
hard
i
learned
a
lot
too
and
she's
well
connected
love
this
class
-----
human
rights
in
documentary
was
a
great
class
each
class
is
a
film
screening
and
sometimes
guest
speakers
the
assignments
are
papers
and
grading
is
simple
aviva
doesn't
care
about
mla
formatting
she
cares
more
about
the
things
that
matter:
understanding
human
rights
being
engaged
getting
something
more
out
of
a
class
than
just
a
grade
-----
i've
taken
several
classes
with
aviva
and
she's
amazing
she
can
be
a
hard
grader
at
times
because
she
expects
a
lot
but
if
you
love
documentaries
you
will
love
her
and
her
classes
i
promise
i've
never
received
anything
lower
than
an
a-
in
any
of
her
classes
only
because
i
did
my
work
and
i
did
it
well
she
won't
let
you
slide
with
crap
papers
-----
i
took
all
three
of
aviva's
classes
and
was
continually
impressed
both
by
the
material
covered
and
by
aviva's
thoughtfulness
aviva
cares
about
each
student
and
is
always
available
to
help
them
and
listen
she
was
one
of
the
best
professors
i
had
at
nyu
and
i
would
encourage
everyone
to
take
a
class
from
her
-----
disrespects
opinions
even
her
guests
sometimes
addressed
a
format
issue
with
my
paper
she
never
spoke
to
me
about
to
whole
class
w
o
naming
me
but
quoted
a
line
from
my
paper
emailed
question
about
final
paper
called
me
irresponsible
for
starting
it
2
days
before
due
really
it
got
done
i
got
an
a-
but
i
will
never
take
her
class
again
-----
prof
slesin
is
an
amazing
educator
she
cares
deeply
about
her
students'
ability
to
think
critically
about
the
world
&
encourages
them
to
look
beyond
the
docs
in
class
to
find
their
passion
&
then
question
everything
those
that
aren't
used
to
independent
thinking
&
prefer
the
easy
path
of
parroting
the
prof
will
be
frustrated
in
her
classes
-----
aviva
believes
each
student
will
have
their
own
viewpoint
and
seems
to
respect
that
until
you
get
your
paper
back
and
her
markings
tend
to
only
allude
to
the
fact
she
doesn't
agree
therefore
your
grade
reflects
such
came
to
discuss
with
her
which
she
blurted
out
before
i
said
a
word
i'm
not
discussing
your
grade
i
don't
even
know
why
you
came
-----
amazing
professor
one
of
my
favorite
at
nyu
she
took
a
personal
interest
in
each
student
-----
aviva's
class
taught
me
to
love
and
appreciate
documentaries
aviva's
insight
to
the
films
and
their
construction
has
helped
me
immensely
as
a
filmmaker
her
passion
for
documentaries
is
contagious
-----
i
switched
into
this
class
immediately
after
the
first
day
because
the
professor
she
takes
documentary
making
and
human
rights
seriously
but
her
goal
is
to
spark
each
student's
passion
interest
through
the
documentary
lens
was
an
eye-opening
class
and
i
would
recommend
this
class
and
professor
to
all
my
friends
at
nyuyou
will
learn
a
lot
-----
she
is
very
unprofessional
throughout
her
course
she
told
me
that
my
papers
were
done
well
until
the
last
day
of
class
in
which
she
told
me
that
i
couldn't
write
at
a
college
level
and
that
she
would
pass
me
but
nothing
more
i
attended
all
her
classes
and
actively
participated
but
still
managed
to
be
a
horrible
teacher
and
person
-----
aviva's
strengths
are
in
the
love
she
shows
for
doc
films
and
the
great
high-profile
guests
she
brings
to
class
lots
of
in-class
discussions
and
there
was
a
3
page
paper
each
week
on
the
film
screened
in
class
as
well
as
two
8
page
papers
if
you're
interested
in
docs
or
want
to
learn
more
about
them
you
can't
go
wrong
with
aviva
-----
class
structure
is
4-5
essays
ranging
from
one
to
two
pages
and
a
critical
review
that
is
longer
it
is
advised
to
attend
class
because
we
go
over
the
sources
that
we
will
use
in
our
essays
if
you
listen
to
what
he
says
you
can
use
it
in
your
essay
main
sources
used
were
the
bible
and
the
source
book
rabbinic
stories
book
was
for
context
info
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
i
had
at
nyu
it
is
very
easy
to
do
well
on
essays
but
his
exams
are
a
bit
more
difficult
for
discussion
sections
definitely
choose
avi
miller
if
you
can
and
participation
is
very
important
he
tries
to
relate
the
class
to
real
life
experiences
and
really
makes
you
think
about
the
texts
and
about
life
-----
seems
like
a
great
funny
guy
and
that's
nice
and
all
but
the
class
sucked
his
lecture
style
seemed
really
rigid
and
lacked
giving
the
main
point
of
whatever
we
were
talking
about
it
was
clearly
a
required
class
that
no
one
wanted
to
attend
and
he
didn't
do
a
whole
lot
to
change
that
-----
awesome
teacher
he
made
lectures
extremely
interesting
that
being
said
there
is
a
lot
of
reading
and
you
should
do
it
all
attend
all
lectures
and
the
midterm
and
final
will
go
smoothly
seriously
go
to
all
lectures
if
you
do
what
he
tells
you
then
you
will
get
a
good
grade
in
the
class
and
learn
a
lot
about
the
world
-----
rubenstein
is
by
far
the
greatest
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
i
had
him
for
jewish
ethics
and
then
again
for
texts
&
ideas
the
topics
we
discuss
are
interesting
and
he
makes
the
material
fun
and
inspiring
his
jokes
are
funny
and
class
goes
by
very
quickly
do
the
readings
won't
do
well
on
tests
or
in
recitation
without
them
-----
rubenstein
was
a
solid
professor
attendance
isnt
mandatory
and
i
didnt
even
read
half
the
texts
assigned
and
still
got
good
grades
on
tests
make
sure
you
have
good
notes
he
always
tries
to
make
people
laugh
with
a
corny
joke
but
all
in
all
a
decent
professor
-----
professor
rubenstein
makes
the
concepts
he
discusses
palatable
and
understandable
it's
not
that
his
tests
essays
are
hard
per-se
but
he
sticks
pretty
rigidly
to
the
core
standards
of
grading
meaning
only
10%
of
students
get
as
25%
a-s
etc
in
my
year
he
curved
down
so
that
students
had
to
get
a
97
for
an
a
but
if
you
work
hard
should
be
fine
-----
prof
rubenstein
is
a
solid
choice
for
texts&ideas
he
is
sympathetic
to
the
fact
many
are
only
taking
the
course
b
c
it's
required
and
attempts
to
make
it
meaningful
to
all
students
might
not
be
the
best
choice
if
you
really
enjoy
the
subject
material
because
it
often
feels
as
if
he
is
dumbing
down
the
material
in
lectures
-----
professor
rubenstein
was
great
for
jewish
ethics
the
class
is
a
seminar
so
be
ready
to
do
a
lot
of
talking
the
topics
he
picked
were
interesting
and
he
did
a
great
job
leading
class
discussions
he
will
discuss
criteria
for
papers
in
class
and
is
easy
to
email
you
will
need
to
buy
some
textbooks
though
and
you
will
need
to
use
them
-----
professor
rubenstein
is
great
he
is
really
engaging
and
makes
the
topic
interesting
i
would
recommend
him
over
any
other
text
and
ideas
teacher
if
you
do
the
reading
a
participate
you
will
likely
do
well
-----
prof
rubenstein
was
one
of
my
favorites
i
absorbed
every
word
from
his
lectures
some
claimed
they
fell
asleep
but
i
love
reading
and
analyzing
also
he
threw
in
some
jokes
every
now
and
then
to
liven
up
the
class
:
-----
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
teachers
in
freshman
year
he
was
funny
and
always
prepared
with
some
sort
of
funny
joke
or
story
the
class
is
not
hard
and
the
material
is
interesting
pay
attention
in
lectures
and
participate
in
recitations
-----
took
him
for
text
and
ideas
enjoyed
the
class
immensely
just
because
everyday
he'd
be
prepared
for
a
joke
and
would
come
into
class
to
try
to
make
everyone
happy
must
come
to
class
for
all
the
concepts
that
will
just
be
duplicated
in
class
wonderful
teacher
and
get
josh
schwartz
as
your
ta
if
you
can
-----
to
be
honest
i
wish
i
hadn't
done
all
the
readings
sure
it
might
have
been
intellectually
engaging;
but
any
student
who
was
able
to
rip
the
notes
off
of
class
could
ace
the
class
with
a
sparknotes
understanding
of
the
text
furthermore
this
class
fully
depends
on
the
tas
and
what
they
expect
from
you
go
to
class
take
notes
get
the
concepts
-----
i
had
him
for
texts
&
ideas
attendance
is
mandatory
for
the
recitations
there's
a
good
amount
of
reading
but
he
splits
it
up
so
you
don't
have
a
lot
in
one
night
the
lectures
cover
a
lot
of
material
-
i
missed
one
and
was
completely
lost
the
next
class
not
terrible
to
listen
to
exams
are
straightforward
-----
i
took
this
class
as
a
senior
my
advice
to
everyone
#1
get
the
class
out
of
the
way
early
the
ta
said
freshman
generally
do
the
best
in
the
class
#2
dont
do
the
readings
unfortunately
i
read
everything
and
its
not
tested
#3
do
not
apply
your
own
ideas
to
responses
he
looks
for
wrote
memorization
ie
lecture
material
&
handouts
-----
jewish
ethics
class
thought-provoking
and
pleasant
grading
especially
tough
participation
grades
can
be
killers
high
expectations
but
low
workload
-
so
measure
every
word
carefully
learned
a
lot
so
can't
hold
the
grade
against
him
overall
good
experience
-
and
very
good
prof
to
deal
with
-----
classes
are
actually
pretty
amusing
and
basically
hands
you
the
exams
ahead
of
time
but
there
is
way
too
much
reading
this
guy
thinks
that
the
only
way
to
learn
is
to
read
50
pages
a
night
i
didn't
read
a
single
thing
and
still
got
an
a
-----
con
west
was
pretty
good
for
a
required
class
though
recitations
sucked
mainly
because
of
the
people
in
it
all
you
have
to
do
for
the
tests
is
write
down
exactly
what
he
says
in
lecture
granted
i'm
a
little
obsessive
compulsive
and
write
down
almost
everything
very
enlightening
-----
i
love
professor
rubenstein
i
wasn't
terribly
interested
in
the
course
when
i
signed
up
but
he
made
it
interesting
and
worthwhile
excellent
teacher
-----
human
societies&cultures
had
to
be
one
of
the
best
classes
i
have
taken
at
nyu
it
is
an
intro
course
and
the
workload
is
rather
heavy
but
when
you
commit
to
doing
all
the
readers
and
staying
engaged
during
lectures
and
recs
you
will
surely
love
the
class
and
prof
as
well
if
i
could
i
would
def
take
another
class
with
prof
r
musttake
-----
human
societies
and
cultures
is
one
of
the
best
courses
to
take
at
nyu
professor
rademacher
makes
class
both
fun
and
engaging
at
the
time;
her
passion
for
the
subject
truly
shows
through
her
lectures
which
are
amazing
though
it
can
be
difficult
and
there
are
lots
of
rather
dense
readings
i'd
highly
recommend
taking
the
class
-----
professor
rademacher's
lectures
are
exceptional
and
engaging
there
is
a
good
amount
of
reading
but
work
load
is
moderate
the
class
will
change
your
life
if
you
commit
to
connecting
with
the
very
relevant
material
rademacher's
expertise
and
advice
is
one
of
a
kind
relish
this
chance
to
learn
from
a
great
you'll
get
as
much
as
you
put
in
-----
extremely
lecture
and
reading
heavy
her
grading
criteria
was
never
made
clear
and
she
is
definitely
a
tough
grader
i
found
the
readings
and
her
lectures
to
be
so
incredibly
fascinating
even
at
9:30am
i
felt
unable
to
truly
display
my
knowledge
of
the
material
there
is
no
guidance
for
the
final
project
with
results
in
majors
stress
-----
i
only
had
one
class
with
prof
rademacher
but
i
wish
i'd
been
able
to
take
more
before
i
graduated
she's
easily
one
of
the
best
professors
i
had
at
nyu:
engaging
intelligent
and
actually
cares
if
her
students
are
learning
don't
expect
to
sit
back
and
not
talk
and
don't
go
if
you
want
an
easy
a
she
grades
fairly
but
she
has
high
expectations
-----
she
grades
ridiculously
hard
and
is
unfair
in
my
opinion
she
does
not
explain
her
prompts
very
well
i
would
not
recommend
this
professor
at
all
gpa
for
sure
and
i
took
her
for
an
elective
course
-----
i've
had
professor
rademacher
for
2
classes
now
and
have
increased
my
knowledge
in
metropolitan
and
environmental
studies
tremendously
her
classes
are
intellectually
rigorous
and
will
teach
you
mostly
how
to
think
critically
rather
than
what
exactly
to
think
prepare
to
be
challenged
and
rewarded
-----
professor
rademacher
is
an
extremely
sharp
insightful
instructor
that
challenges
her
students
with
rigourous
coursework
and
discussions
every
student
should
be
fortunate
enough
to
have
her
at
least
once
in
their
college
career
-----
i've
had
anne
for
2
classes
now
env
&
soc
&
thinking
globally
acting
locally
she's
easily
one
of
the
best
prof's
i've
had
at
nyu
if
you're
a
social
theorist
don't
miss
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
with
her
she
will
challenge
you
and
she
has
high
expectations
but
she
is
also
extremely
fair
i
wish
more
profs
taught
like
her
-----
the
lectures
are
excellent
some
of
the
best
i've
heard
at
nyu
and
r
brings
interesting
experiences
and
stories
writing
assignments
are
tough
&
you
have
to
keep
up
with
readings
but
i
learned
a
lot
great
class
-----
r
is
a
great
professor
she
obviously
loves
teaching
and
is
really
enthusiastic
about
urban
studies
there
is
a
lot
of
reading
but
it's
really
interesting
there
are
only
5
assignments
but
they're
difficult
so
utilize
the
amazing
tas
and
ask
for
lots
of
guidance
and
feedback
about
the
commentaries
if
you
do
all
the
reading
the
final
is
easy
-----
she
is
very
energetic
and
i
can't
decide
if
its
cute
or
annoying;
however
she
is
very
knowledgeable
and
has
had
many
experiences
in
the
field
lectures
are
mandatory
and
the
best
part
of
the
class
sadly
no
computers
for
notes
the
readings
are
extensive
but
give
you
lots
to
work
with
for
the
commentary
assignments
5
total
which
are
brutal
-----
the
essays
are
really
tough
and
the
readings
are
dense
the
class
however
was
fascinating
even
if
recitations
were
often
useless
she
was
an
energetic
professor
and
obviously
very
knowledgeable
i'm
glad
i
took
the
class
must
be
on
time
must
attend
every
lecture
-----
there
is
indeed
much
text
to
cover
in
this
class
but
for
the
most
part
they're
straightforward
readings
she
does
not
summarize
the
readings
in
lecture
but
instead
provides
us
with
some
background
on
the
topic
which
i
found
helpful
for
the
final
which
is
a
set
of
essays
beware
of
pop
quizes
on
the
readings
-----
too
much
reading
in
too
little
time
the
class
should
really
be
discussion
based
but
all
she
does
is
lecture
at
us
-----
seems
a
little
unsure
of
herself
at
first
but
after
a
couple
classes
she's
a
great
lecturer
she
knows
her
stuff
and
she's
done
really
interesting
work
which
brings
great
stories
readings
are
interesting
and
great
extra
credit
opportunities
for
the
final
-----
no
comments
-----
great
professor;
yale
grad
school;
she
is
probably
the
most
helpful
professor
you
will
find
class
was
easy
as
long
as
you
kept
up
with
the
reading
somewhat
-----
great
professor
seems
a
bit
boring
at
first
but
becomes
much
more
comfortable
presents
interesting
material
even
humorous
great
class
-----
very
good
professors
help
students
a
lot
explain
things
well
in
the
class
follow
closely
with
the
textbook
-----
kleeman
always
has
office
hours
to
help
students
who
don't
understand
material
is
very
kind
his
lectures
always
end
early
and
they
do
move
a
bit
fast
so
you
may
need
to
read
the
textbook
sometimes
hw
worth
40%
midterm
20%
and
final
40%
normally
everyone
does
well
on
the
midterm
but
he
chooses
who
gets
the
a's
based
off
of
a
very
hard
final
-----
for
calculus
iii
professor
kleeman
always
ends
class
at
least
30
minutes
early
quizzes
are
easy
and
webassign
is
tedious
homework
tends
to
be
very
tough
the
formatting
is
all
over
the
place
--
the
quizzes
don't
look
like
the
midterm
which
doesn't
look
like
the
webassign
which
doesn't
look
like
the
final
but
that's
a
curriculum
choice
-----
professor
kleeman's
lectures
are
mostly
straight
from
the
textbook
he
explains
theorems
and
proofs
followed
by
one
or
two
examples;
his
lectures
always
end
early
but
that
does
not
mean
he
skips
anything
attendance
is
a
small
part
of
your
grade
and
he
is
always
available
during
office
hours
quizzes
are
pretty
easy
and
tests
are
very
reasonable
-----
a
very
charming
man
his
midterms
are
very
easy
he
allows
a
cheat
sheet
to
exams
and
you
could
write
anything
on
them
i
never
went
to
lecture
and
got
an
easy
a
the
final
is
kind
of
difficult
but
because
its
departmental
the
written
assignments
are
slightly
difficult
but
there
very
few
of
them
there
are
no
pop
quizzes
lectures
end
45m
early
-----
mostly
organized
lectures
that
almost
always
end
early
but
are
rather
boring
sometimes
his
examples
can
be
unclear
but
usually
the
textbook
can
help
allows
for
a
page
of
notes
during
the
midterm
and
the
final
and
grades
fairly
if
you
don't
show
up
make
sure
to
have
a
friend
who
will
take
notes
for
you
or
be
willing
to
read
the
textbook
-----
ends
his
lectures
up
to
45minutes
early
and
teaches
almost
exactly
from
the
textbook
only
few
homework
assignments
and
quizzes
midterms
are
fair
and
he
allows
a
sheet
of
notes
for
both
the
examples
he
gives
in
class
are
clear
but
there
aren't
a
lot
of
them
attendance
is
a
part
of
the
grade
he
is
very
helpful
when
you
need
extra
explaining
help
-----
professor
kleeman's
class
was
super
tough
but
that
seems
to
just
be
a
characteristic
of
the
nyu
math
department
in
general
he
definitely
knows
what
he's
talking
about
and
is
pretty
good
at
communicating
that
to
his
students
he
always
ends
lectures
early
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you're
missing
out
on
material
he
just
has
it
all
planned
out
-----
take
this
professor
he
is
amazing
and
is
very
clear
with
his
lectures
learned
so
much
in
his
class
and
keeps
you
engaged
most
of
the
time
so
it
is
not
hard
to
pay
attention
also
always
ends
class
early
which
is
the
best
definitely
take
him
-----
kleeman
is
an
awesome
professor
he
understands
the
material
can
be
tough
and
usually
grades
accordingly
it's
also
nice
that
he's
super
organized
and
always
has
a
lecture
planned
out
beforehand
-----
good
professor
teaches
out
of
the
book
but
pretty
clear
and
helpful
in
his
lectures
if
you
ask
for
help
he'll
give
it
and
he
grades
pretty
fair
in
my
opinion
-----
chillest
professor
ever
lets
class
out
very
early
most
of
the
time
not
a
lot
of
homework
work
load
is
manageable
exams
are
very
fair
highly
recommend
him
-----
the
questions
this
guy
gives
for
everything
are
easy
as
heck
there
was
one
problem
that
was
badly-posed
but
he
gave
us
a
lot
of
points
on
that
one
overall
a
great
professor
chill
and
doesn't
assign
homework
very
often
it's
easy
when
he
does
he
leaves
a
lot
of
room
for
self-study
and
exploration
and
ends
class
early
-----
i
had
him
for
linear
algebra
excellent
professor
presented
organized
easily
understandable
lectures
and
gave
very
little
homework
-----
charming
and
ends
class
early
but
the
positives
stop
there
assigns
the
most
annoying
problems
for
homework
which
will
not
save
you
on
his
tests
anyway
grades
you
down
for
trivial
things
too
teaches
out
of
the
book
makes
no
difference
if
you
show
for
class
has
no
syllabus
you
will
be
amazed
how
hard
this
guy
can
make
calculus
i
-----
i
really
don't
understand
why
this
professor
is
rated
so
lowly
he
certainly
isn't
that
bad
a
teacher
or
that
hard
of
one
i
thought
he
was
very
fair
while
he's
not
the
most
helpful
teacher
he
wasn't
terrible
either
-----
he
teaches
more
or
less
straight
from
the
book
i
really
wish
i
didn't
have
him
for
calc
iii
i
don't
feel
like
i
got
anything
out
of
it
-----
all
he
does
is
read
straight
from
the
book
don't
bother
going
to
class
it
won't
help
you
understand
homework
is
40%
of
the
grade
but
very
difficult
the
final
is
60%
and
it
is
even
more
difficult
if
you
have
a
choice
between
jumping
off
the
top
floor
of
bobst
and
taking
his
class
jump
-----
this
man
has
no
interest
in
teaching
he
makes
that
very
clear
he
has
no
interest
in
helping
the
students
doesn't
give
a
syllabus
or
regular
homework
and
your
whole
grade
is
based
on
one
completely
unfair
test
avoid
like
the
plague
-----
foley
is
a
teacher
that
will
force
the
work
out
of
you
if
you
are
not
ready
to
work
ie
write
read
and
write
some
more
he
probably
won'
be
a
great
choice
for
you
also
there
were
many
times
when
i
was
confused
with
the
criteria
but
foley
does
conferences
for
each
essay
and
they
were
extremely
helpful
overall
eye-opening
experience
of
my
growth
-----
david
is
very
accessible
outside
of
class
and
will
give
you
extra
hope
if
you
want
to
it
the
homework
although
it
is
more
than
the
usual
it
helps
you
in
the
end
when
you
were
constructing
the
essay
drafts
amazing
professor
-----
okay
heres
the
deal
yes
theres
homework
but
it
kinda
therapeutic
to
write
in
a
starbucks
nearby
its
not
even
a
lot
all
the
people
commenting
are
slackers
you
can
easily
finish
an
essay
over
a
weekend
without
stressing
because
he
gives
really
good
feedback
and
individual
attention
sometimes
class
is
a
bore
but
hes
great
pls
take
-----
david
foley
is
a
wonderful
professor
he
gives
you
good
notes
on
essay
drafts
that
help
you
develop
your
ideas
more
thoroughly
the
exercises
we
do
in
class
are
very
helpful
and
they
are
not
just
busy
irrelevant
work
i
have
grown
so
much
as
a
writer
in
his
class
he
is
amazing
definitely
recommend
as
a
professor
-----
-will
make
you
a
better
writer
but
you're
gonna
have
to
actually
try
-do
all
the
assignments
and
hit
the
requirements
for
your
paper
and
you'll
be
fine
-participate
every
now
and
then
-bit
of
a
stickler
on
attendance
but
if
you
reach
out
about
illness
he's
a
bit
flexible
-nice
but
will
give
you
a
bad
grade
if
you
don't
do
the
work
-----
go
in
ready
to
learn
don't
feel
bad
when
he
tells
you
don't
know
as
much
as
you
thought
he's
right
the
only
way
to
do
well
is
to
participate
and
do
all
the
assignments
no
bsing
your
way
through
very
flexible
with
late
assignments
&
missing
class
provided
you
have
a
good
reason
and
are
participating
in
class
he
will
challenge
you
-----
after
starting
my
second
semester
with
a
new
teacher
i
realized
how
much
bs
work
we
had
to
do
in
his
class
the
stuff
we
did
in
class
was
for
the
most
part
a
waste
of
time
and
the
homwork
can
sometimes
take
forever
i
feel
like
i
grew
a
lot
as
a
thinker
not
so
much
as
a
writer
though
-----
too
much
work
this
class
is
taking
up
a
good
3
4
of
my
weeks
work
time
and
is
almost
irrelevant
to
what
i
came
to
study
here
means
well
but
just
stresses
and
depresses
-----
you
definitely
need
to
put
some
effort
into
this
class
but
he
is
an
amazing
teacher
and
really
helpful
he
wants
you
to
learn
and
become
a
better
writer
and
critic
i
learned
so
much
in
this
class
and
really
recommend
him
to
any
student
who
is
serious
about
their
education
and
their
voice
in
the
world
great
teacher
-----
foley
is
a
stereotypical
english
professor
who
believes
everything
he
says
is
incredibly
profound
and
complexly
interesting
he
is
generally
known
as
one
of
the
worst
writing
the
essay
teachers
at
nyu
but
he
is
a
surprisingly
forgiving
grader
i
was
stuck
with
him
for
both
semesters
and
it
was
not
a
good
time
-----
ok
so
david
foley
is
bae
if
you
actually
make
an
effort
and
engage
yourself
you
will
grow
so
much
you
need
to
give
yourself
to
him
if
you
want
him
to
give
anything
to
you
he's
witty
and
sweet
and
so
clever
and
i
am
basically
in
very
deep
platonic
love
with
him
i
have
incredible
conversations
with
him
he's
amazing
i
can't
even
bae
i
swear
-----
david
foley
is
the
worst
i
was
taking
his
class
while
struggling
with
depression
and
anxiety
and
he
upped
that
with
his
confusing
advice
and
inconsiderate
attitude
it
did
not
help
having
him
at
8
in
the
morning
and
he
talked
down
to
his
students
he
was
not
very
helpful
and
contradictory
he
made
us
hate
an
already
notorious
class
even
more
-----
he's
well
meant
but
doesn't
teach
that
well
instead
trying
to
focus
on
developing
the
student's
thinking
this
doesn't
work
because
he
overloads
the
amount
of
work
that
he
assigns
which
doesn't
work
well
if
you're
trying
to
develop
your
writing
instead
you
just
end
up
spitting
out
irrelevant
exercises
and
then
failing
up
your
final
papers
-----
this
guy
is
super
into
his
own
intellectualism
every
single
thing
that
came
out
of
his
mouth
was
vague;
nothing
in
this
class
made
any
sense
whatsoever
he's
very
particular
about
little
details
that
don't
matter;
for
instance
he
refused
to
accept
an
essay
because
i
didn't
use
the
right
kind
of
folder
do
not
take
his
class
-----
sohe
is
actually
a
kind
and
caring
guy
he's
pretty
flexible
but
don't
push
it
he
is
so
confusing
my
exercises
didn't
help
me
get
to
my
final
essay
the
in
class
prompts
were
not
helpful
he
always
asks
what
are
the
implications
of
this
and
i
feel
i
did
not
grow
as
a
writer
in
his
class
everyone
pretty
much
gets
some
sort
of
b
-----
very
good
class
loved
it
any
professor
who
will
quote
dfw
on
syllabus
gets
an
automatically
great
rating
-----
the
worst
prof
ever
dosent
help
at
all
only
attacks
your
ideas
he
dosent
even
tell
you
what
is
wrong
do
not
take
his
class
every
one
hates
it
-----
did
not
answer
questions
and
was
very
vague
if
he
did
answer
anything
pretty
much
gave
everyone
a
b
-----
he
was
a
great
teacher
he
was
challenging
yet
always
there
to
help
-----
he's
a
cute
old
man
that
walks
into
class
in
a
matching
suit
old
english
hat
and
cane
but
because
he's
old
very
traditional
and
gives
boring
lectures
he
cannot
hear
or
see
well-yelling
at
him
works
he
d
n
seem
to
comprehend
students'
questions
and
does
not
give
answers
it's
an
easy
class
but
don't
take
him
bc
i
didn't
learn
at
all
-----
this
class
is
an
easy
a
as
long
as
you're
willing
come
to
class
&
do
absolutely
nothing
be
nice
and
smile
he's
very
old
and
sits
at
the
front
of
the
room
just
talking
i
never
read
was
on
fb
everyday
&
got
an
a
there
are
3
papers
a
midterm
and
final
take
notes
for
one
class
on
each
book
so
you
have
something
to
write
on
the
paper
-----
one
word:
old
although
i'm
sure
he
can
teach
the
material
i
feel
as
though
his
age
poses
a
major
problem
when
it
comes
to
his
students
learning
to
appreciate
the
material
his
assignments
are
decent
however
his
grading
can
be
a
bit
strange
i
managed
a
b
but
that's
only
because
i
learned
how
to
study
myself
honestlyjust
take
another
professsor
-----
such
a
boss
he's
the
most
boss
old
man
i've
ever
met
take
him
he's
so
cool
if
you
ask
him
he'll
tell
you
war
stories
from
the
past
and
then
do
a
really
funny
impression
of
nicholas
cage
-----
professor
bell
was
probably
a
great
professor
at
some
point
but
now
he's
much
too
old
and
ill
to
teach
effectively
he
assigns
huge
portions
of
readings
each
class
but
goes
over
each
after
3
papers
a
mid-term
and
a
final
-
fairly
easy
grader
if
you
just
reiterate
some
points
made
in
his
lectures
-----
i've
studied
this
type
of
material
for
years
and
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
--
but--
as
knowledgeable
as
he
was
this
class
really
put
me
to
sleep
i
almost
never
read
anything
beyond
for
papers
and
i
walked
away
with
an
a-
you
never
knew
why
you
got
your
grade
but
i
suppose
my
attendance
and
latter
papers
final
helped
to
get
above
b+
-----
professor
bell
is
a
great
guy
yes
he
is
boring
yes
i
fall
asleep
in
class
all
the
time
but
he
goes
over
the
material
so
although
he
does
assign
a
lot
of
reading
you
don't
have
to
do
anything
the
charges
that
he
will
mark
you
down
for
disagreeing
with
him
is
flat
wrong
i
do
it
all
the
time
and
the
lowest
grade
on
any
essay
was
a
b+
easy
class
-----
he's
a
nice
guy
and
all
but
he's
not
clear
at
all
he'll
ask
for
your
interpretation
and
then
downgrade
you
because
your
interpretation
is
wrong
according
to
his
views
he
rambles
on
and
you
fall
asleep
lectues
are
so
boring
essays
and
midterms
are
based
on
what
he
says
during
class
can't
catch
what
he
says
good
luck
finals
are
easy
own
s
-----
amazing
teacher
keeps
you
on
your
feet
reading
is
interestingthe
type
of
class
to
take
if
you
love
to
learn
very
kind
hearting
and
understanding
man
i
highly
recommend
this
class
-----
love
him
-----
very
funny
nice
and
encouraging
you
can
get
by
without
reading
because
he
goes
over
them
-----
i
love
this
professor
he
evokes
insights
out
of
the
student
and
the
class
is
easy
as
hell
all
you
have
to
do
is
read
and
go
to
class
when
he
assigns
papers
just
reiterate
what
he
already
said
in
class
and
he
will
give
you
an

is
a
funny
old
man

-----
bell's
grading
can
be
very
unfair
he
never
explains
how
he
grades
he
never
gives
clear
guidelines
on
assignments
and
on
exams
we
never
know
what
he
expects
he
never
admits
he
does
not
know
the
answer
to
questions
he
just
****s
and
no
one
know
what
he
talks
about
never
take
his
class
a
lot
of
people
get
b-
or
c
-----
he's
really
into
the
subject
and
i
like
it
when
he
goes
off
into
historical
tangents
because
they're
very
interesting
the
only
thing
is
that
the
book
are
interesting
but
he
talks
a
lot
about
their
socio-political
background
and
they're
the
same
for
a
lot
of
the
books
it
got
really
repetitive
-----
the
class
is
quite
tough
and
he
expects
a
lot
from
his
students
but
you
do
learn
a
lot
also
his
writing
assignments
are
not
really
clear
which
can
be
frustrating
overall
you
get
out
of
the
class
what
you
put
into
it
-----
a
great
teacher
he
pushed
all
his
students
to
think
without
being
pretentious
or
condescending
i
got
a
lot
out
of
his
class
and
would
recommend
his
class
to
anyone
-----
nice
older
guy
learned
a
lot
makes
ya
think
-----
i
was
uncertain
about
taking
an
anthropology
class
at
first
but
i
ended
up
loving
it
there
are
a
lot
of
readings
but
few
are
dry
or
annoying
to
get
through
while
the
paper
prompts
can
be
vague
summarizing
the
relevant
aspects
of
readings
got
me
an
a
every
time
professor
schieffelin
is
great
to
talk
to
and
her
knowledge
is
impressive
-----
prof
schieffelin
is
an
extremely
harsh
grader
i
tried
everything
to
make
her
happy
but
still
did
not
receive
a
grade
that
i
worked
hard
for
there
is
no
clear
criteria
for
her
papers
so
beware
she
will
not
be
specific
about
what
she
ultimately
is
looking
for
class
is
interesting;however
there
is
no
room
for
individual
creativity
-----
i've
been
bamboozled
this
isn't
a
language
class
if
you
sign
up
for
it
thinking
it
will
be
think
again
-----
bambi
is
by
far
my
favorite
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
although
she
expects
a
lot
from
her
students
both
amount
and
difficulty
of
reading
but
also
paper
wise
her
criticism
feedback
is
beyond
helpful
for
developing
your
writing
skills
not
only
for
her
class
but
also
in
the
fields
of
anthropology
and
sociolinguistics
as
a
whole
-----
took
this
as
a
seminar
last
semester
and
i
will
say
there
are
highs
and
lows
the
class
is
long
about
25
hours
but
only
once
a
week
bambi
is
an
amazing
teacherthe
material
is
great
and
overall
the
class
is
really
rewarding
however
her
assignments
are
incredibly
vague
so
i
suggest
meeting
with
her
at
least
once
to
get
a
feel
of
what
she
wants
-----
her
class
is
an
easy
a
as
long
as
you
skim
the
readings
and
are
a
decent
writer
she
assigns
a
lot
of
essays
but
most
of
them
are
just
summaries
of
the
reading
materials
and
therefore
simple
to
complete
she'll
email
you
to
ask
where
you
were
if
you
miss
class
so
you
have
to
attend
overall
she
is
fairly
strict
but
i
enjoyed
her
class
-----
as
someone
here
already
mentioned
the
class
is
more
focused
on
anthropology
than
linguistics
but
we
do
have
'language'
components
sometimes
the
readings
are
really
long
and
you
have
to
do
mandatory
but
not
graded
study
questions
for
them
each
week
the
assignments
and
grading
are
really
vague
but
if
you
do
the
work
then
you
should
be
fine
-----
passionate
about
class
material
but
extremely
ambiguous
when
it
comes
to
assignment
directions
and
grades
harshly
when
you
don't
guess
what
she
was
looking
for
workload
is
extremely
dense
with
6-8
page
essays
each
week
in
addition
to
100+
pages
of
reading
and
study
questions
unless
you're
ready
to
devote
the
semester
to
anthropology
avoid
-----
she
is
an
alright
professor
if
you
think
her
class
is
about
language
think
again
more
of
an
anthropology
course
assigns
a
ridiculous
amount
of
reading
each
week
and
assigns
work
that
is
checked
but
not
graded
so
you're
basically
up
all
night
to
get
it
done
for
nothing
if
you
want
to
have
a
life
don't
take
this
class
-----
you
will
never
have
free
time
6-8
page
paper
due
the
second
week
of
class
and
the
fifth
and
sixth
etc
150-200
page
readings
every
week
class
is
25
hours
also
don't
be
fooled
by
the
course
nameit
is
not
a
language
or
linguistics
course;
it
is
an
anthropology
course
intense
course
for
a
first-semester
freshman
-----
she
is
one
of
the
nicest
and
most
helpful
professors
the
only
drawback
is
that
she
assigns
so
much
work
if
you
wanna
have
a
life
don't
take
her
class
or
never
finish
the
work
-----
the
worst
teacher
i've
had
at
nyu
not
clear
about
the
assignments
and
does
not
encourage
original
thought
in
the
assignments
only
summaries
of
the
text
she's
very
nice
as
a
person
but
she
is
not
an
engaging
teacher
and
the
readings
are
awful
this
class
is
a
complete
waste
of
money
and
time
i
am
so
bummed
i
didn't
switch
out
immediately
-----
the
course
was
great
laid
back
yet
well
instructed
bambi
is
truly
cool
reasonable
helpful
and
dedicated
to
her
study
she'll
make
you
love
language
and
inspire
you
to
learn
more
fair
grader
the
ta
chantal
white
was
great
they
were
an
awesome
team
-----
bambi
is
the
love
of
my
life
she
is
seriously
the
best
professor
teacher
i
have
ever
encountered
her
classes
are
challenging
but
she
is
definitely
there
to
help
everyone
she
is
understanding
fun
and
pretty
much
the
coolest
educator
on
this
planet
take
this
class
you
def
won't
regret
it
-----
bambi
is
wonderful
her
classes
are
interesting
and
she
is
very
laid
back
and
has
a
ton
of
experience
there
is
a
lot
of
work
but
it
isn't
that
bad
and
if
you
do
the
readings
and
study
questions
the
papers
will
be
super
easy
all
in
all
this
class
is
the
most
work
but
it's
my
favorite
and
i
am
doing
better
than
in
any
other
class
great
prof
-----
i
love
bambi
the
workload
for
her
class
is
pretty
big
but
she's
very
lenient
and
understanding
about
late
assignments
and
she
will
always
take
homework
assignments
by
e-mail
or
after
the
due
date
as
long
as
you're
honest
about
it
she
is
a
great
professor
-
she
really
knows
what
she's
talking
about
and
she
really
cares
about
her
students
-----
be
prepared
to
do
a
ridiculous
amount
of
work
she's
very
nice
but
doesn't
care
if
your
swamped
or
have
tons
of
homework
every
class
you
will
spend
all
your
free
time
doing
her
work
-----
i've
had
bambi
twice;
she's
always
been
caring
and
lenient
classes
are
fun
never
stuffy
i've
never
had
a
midterm
or
final
with
her
but
be
prepared
to
do
quite
a
bit
of
reading
and
writing
nevertheless
if
you're
interested
in
taking
linguistic
anthro
i
reccomend
her
over
anyone
else
-----
todd
is
a
really
interesting
professor
an
all
star
at
the
top
of
the
world
i
honestly
sit
in
awe
watching
this
legend
at
work
but
half
the
time
some
of
the
stuff
he
says
is
very
hard
to
follow
youll
either
really
love
him
or
struggle
in
the
class
his
grading
criteria
is
not
clear
at
all
and
when
hes
made
up
his
mind
thats
it
so
be
good
-----
not
a
very
easy
class
in
my
opinion
for
a
life
sciences
requirement
pretty
in
depth
raw
class
averages
on
exams
are
in
the
mid
60's
range
and
the
questions
are
really
specific
no
words
on
slides
10
pop
quizzes
throughout
term
-----
took
this
for
cas
life
science
requirement
-
good
choice
if
you're
not
great
at
science
material
can
be
boring
at
times
but
it's
relevant
and
exams
are
fairly
easy
and
labs
provide
a
great
opportunity
to
raise
your
grade
disotell
also
frequently
tells
funny
anecdotes
which
relate
to
the
material
-----
he
is
really
awesome
i
really
like
his
lectures
and
style
of
teaching
but
if
you
are
not
super
interested
in
anthropology
don't
take
his
class
anthropology
is
not
a
blow
off
science
class
its
actually
pretty
tough
his
tests
are
all
short
answer
medium
answer
and
long
answer
as
he
puts
it
and
you
must
know
the
material
inside
and
out
-----
great
professor
really
enjoyed
the
class
definitely
geared
for
students
who
are
interested
in
being
anthropology
majors
midterm
was
difficult
definitely
suggest
studying
hard
for
his
tests
otherwise
classes
are
interesting
and
you
learn
a
lot
highly
recommend
his
class
to
any
anthro
major
-----
he
is
really
intelligent
and
knows
his
stuff
however
he
is
not
a
fair
grader
his
grading
system
is
ambiguous
and
if
you
care
about
your
grade
avoid
his
class
-----
took
human
evolution
emerging
diseases
human
variation
and
hope
to
take
any
of
his
graduate
courses
i
can
get
into
next
semester
he
is
hands
down
the
best
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
-----
loved
him
so
funny
intelligent
interesting
he
plays
the
daily
show
clips
in
class
and
he's
just
a
great
guy
anyone
and
everyone
should
take
a
class
with
him
-----
i
loved
professor
disotell's
class
i
had
him
for
human
evolution
and
it
was
my
favorite
class
the
semester
i
took
it
he's
really
funny
and
the
lectures
were
entertaining
the
exams
were
a
bit
hard
but
if
you
pay
attention
during
the
review
and
you
study
enough
they're
fine
-----
disotell
is
about
as
good
as
it
could
get
in
a
nat
sci
class
he's
entertaing
sometimes
and
seems
real
nice
midterm
comes
out
of
nowherelectures
are
difficult
to
get
through
overall
too
in
depth
for
a
map
class
if
you
don't
have
a
real
interest
in
the
topic
i'd
say
take
a
different
nat
sci
class
but
this
one
isn't
awful
if
you
take
it
-----
disotell
is
amazing
i
think
he
is
absolutely
the
best
his
lectures
are
soo
clear
and
so
well
structured
he
knows
exactly
what
he's
saying
and
how
to
explain
it
well
i
heard
good
things
about
harrison
and
was
upset
that
i
had
to
take
disotell
but
i'm
so
glad
i'm
in
disotell's
section
i'm
so
excited
i'm
taking
his
class
next
semester
-----
definitely
the
coolest
professor
i've
ever
had
a
fun
guy
and
makes
lectures
interesting
explanations
are
usually
very
clear
he
also
has
a
mohawk
great
taste
in
music
can
be
taken
as
a
natural
science
ii
requirement
for
gsp
and
although
it's
a
cas
class
it's
not
that
hard
the
labs
involve
a
little
bit
of
work
but
are
still
worth
it
-----
he's
not
a
bad
professor
in
fact
he's
pretty
good
he
does
tend
to
oversimplify
things
but
he
is
very
amusing
to
listen
to
and
seemed
to
genuinely
want
to
help
those
who
cared
at
all
about
the
subject
but
yeah
you
really
didn't
have
to
come
to
class
which
was
quite
wonderful
-----
very
informative
and
creative
slideshow
presentations
really
dense
reading
can
be
rather
dry
and
boring
at
times
awesome
mohawk
and
monkey
shirts
-----
he
is
such
a
brilliant
teachermaybe
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
had
his
lectures
are
very
clear
and
informative
the
only
thing
is
that
the
tests
are
very
difficult
since
the
questions
are
all
short
answers
no
mc
so
basically
u
have
to
memorize
the
whole
book
overall
i
recommend
this
professor
-----
this
is
the
best
lecture
class
i've
ever
taken
-
funny
well-designed
interesting
disotell
wants
to
see
everyone
do
well
and
he
succeeds
in
simplifying
very
complicated
information
without
making
it
dry
and
irrelevant
he
made
mitosis
interesting
he
can
do
anything
plus
he
has
a
mohawk
-----
i
hated
biology
before
i
took
this
class
now
i
only
hate
parts
of
it
i
lovingly
dubbed
it
'monkeys
and
cavemen'
he
is
an
engaging
professor
who
really
knows
his
stuff
and
he
likes
the
simpsons
and
he
felt
approachable
did
i
mention
he
likes
the
simpsons
even
if
he
quotes
in
incorrectly
yes
-----
take
any
class
w
this
prof
he
is
brilliant
no
nonsense
and
is
an
outstanding
source
of
scientific
current
events
information
-----
elaine
was
honestly
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
ever
had
her
class
was
structured
so
that
there
was
a
small
amount
of
work
due
every
class
and
attendance
was
enforced
but
no
one
wanted
to
miss
her
class
because
it
was
so
fun
and
enlightening
she's
brilliant
and
cares
about
her
students
more
than
any
bureaucratic
nyu
nonsense
-----
horrible
teacher
i
don't
know
how
she
can
call
herself
an
educator
most
people
in
the
major
who
have
taken
her
courses
come
out
angry
confused
and
not
having
learned
anything
there
are
many
other
professors
at
nyu
who
are
intelligent
and
care
about
students
if
you're
thinking
of
taking
her
class
on
some
mistaken
notion
reconsider
-----
one
of
my
favorite
professors
at
nyu
great
sense
of
humor
down
to
earth
and
comes
up
with
interesting
fun
topics
for
papers
had
her
for
britlit2
and
she
was
able
to
make
a
survey
course
enjoyable
would
definitely
take
a
class
with
her
again
freedgood
doesn't
put
up
with
disrespectful
or
lazy
students
don't
expect
to
sleep
through
lecture
-----
not
a
class
you
can
slack
off
in
she
does
have
a
temper
sometimes
and
i
agree
that
once
you
get
on
her
bad
time
it's
hard
to
get
off
it
just
don't
get
on
her
bad
side
in
the
first
place:
do
the
work
go
to
class
say
something
interesting
every
now
and
then
she
has
a
great
sense
of
humor
and
a
fascinating
mind
even
if
it's
hard
to
follow
-----
second
class
with
her
hilarious
brilliant
love
this
woman
she
seems
strict
and
intimidating
but
in
fact
she
is
understanding
if
you
talk
to
her
her
paper
assignments
are
difficult
but
like
someone
has
already
said
she
is
looking
for
originality
depending
on
the
topic
she
frequently
doesn't
care
if
you
even
come
to
a
conclusion
take
her
-----
her
class
is
difficult
and
her
assignments
are
vague
but
it
is
worth
it
she
is
incredibly
smart
and
witty
and
her
class
can
be
a
lot
of
fun
she
is
intimidating
but
easy
to
communicate
with
about
problems
you
may
be
having
in
class
everyone
else
is
freaking
out
about
the
assignments
too
but
do
the
work
be
original
and
you
can
get
an
a
-----
horrible
professor
she
is
unbelievably
rude
has
absolutely
no
compassion
for
her
students
and
is
insulting
to
almost
everyone
who
dare
raise
their
hand
in
her
class
making
the
whole
learning
thing
not
very
possible
please
don't
take
this
professor
she
ruined
my
senior
year
-----
freedgood
started
out
as
funny
and
interesting
but
god
forbid
you're
not
an
english
major
she
has
no
patience
for
people
on
a
learning
curve
vague
about
assignments
yet
highly
specific
in
what
she
is
looking
for
when
i
asked
for
help
on
my
final
paper
she
claimed
she
didn't
get
it
and
shoved
it
back
in
my
face
:
-----
what
a
disappointment
this
grad
english
course
quickly
devolved
into
a
power
trip
with
the
professor
continually
criticizing
everyone
in
class
her
assignments
were
vague
and
yet
incredibly
inflexible
she
also
submitted
grades
before
final
papers
were
handed
in
and
then
refused
to
change
them-
ethically
very
questionable
stay
away
-----
she
is
vicious
once
you
are
on
her
bad
side
beware
i
missed
a
meeting
with
her
without
canceling
due
to
illness
and
she
refused
to
accept
my
second
and
final
paper
and
filed
my
grade
as
nc
i've
never
met
a
teacher
who
graded
with
such
emphasis
on
subjective
qualities
such
as
how
much
she
likes
you
-----
terrible
professor
what
a
disaster
her
class
began
easy
and
then
quickly
devolved
into
pseudo
intellectual
absurdity
her
standards
are
very
ambiguous
purportedly
a
class
on
realism
and
the
realistic
it
was
in
fact
about
queer
theory
and
marxist
literary
theory
i
hate
her
-----
for
19th
century
english
novel
she
really
knew
what
she
was
doing
-
it
was
the
best
class
i've
taken
so
far
she
does
have
a
dry
sense
of
humor
and
her
comments
on
papers
can
be
tough
but
she's
always
open
to
input
on
subjects
in
class
-----
inaccessible
caustic
rude
and
over
dramatic
once
told
me
that
i
didn't
deserve
to
come
to
her
office
hours
to
discuss
my
final
because
i
forgot
to
bring
my
book
to
class
that
day
extremely
unprofessional
assignments
are
ambiguous
and
disorganized
and
she
is
either
vague
or
insulting
when
asked
for
clarification
-----
great
teacher
great
motivator
extremely
witty
-----
freedgood
doesn't
really
know
how
to
teach
it
she's
rude
caustic
sarcastic
and
insulting
in
class
and
doesn't
teach
you
to
remedy
the
problems
you
have
that
she
will
harshly
put
you
down
about
taking
her
class
was
generally
very
upsetting
not
only
for
the
grades
but
the
kind
of
things
she
tended
to
say
to
us
in
class
i
highly
recommend
pick
-----
dont
usually
post
but
had
to
respond
to
the
other
review
elaine
is
an
excellent
teacher
not
the
most
organized
but
definitely
worthwhile
-----
awful
teacher
she
hadn't
the
faintest
idea
what
she
was
talking
about
didn't
know
what
she
needed
to
know
about
the
subject
of
her
course
in
order
to
actually
teach
it
to
her
students
in
short:
poorly
organized
ill-educated
a
waste
of
time
and
a
waste
of
a
lot
of
money
-----
guillory
is
an
interesting
professor;
he
definitely
knows
his
stuff
but
sometimes
his
lectures
tend
to
be
dense
and
not
conducive
to
participation
in
class
he
puts
a
big
focus
on
historical
context
over
literary
analysis
your
ta
determines
a
lot
go
to
his
office
hours
at
least
once--he
purportedly
likes
game
of
thrones
-----
what
an
amazing
professor
i
would
take
guillory
again
and
again
if
i
could
he's
witty
clear
in
his
expectations
and
so
so
smart
one
of
the
best
english
professors
nyu
has
to
offer
-----
professor
guillory
is
a
nice
person
but
his
lecture
style
is
too
circuitous
for
my
taste
his
constant
tangents
get
tiresome
after
a
while
and
it
is
difficult
to
take
notes
when
successive
points
don't
match
up
with
each
other
his
tas
also
grade
very
harshly;
you
need
to
be
a
stellar
writer
if
you
want
to
do
well
good
luck
-----
guillory
is
one
of
the
best
lecturers
you
will
encounter
at
nyu
period
every
lecture
is
captivating
sort
of
like
an
essay
with
a
really
brilliant
and
unique
thesis
wonderfully
articulate
a
real
joy
to
attend
his
lecture
there
is
lots
of
reading
and
the
class
is
by
no
means
an
easy-a
but
if
you
commit
to
the
class
you'll
be
fine
-----
guillory
is
kind
and
funny;
his
lectures
and
syllabus
are
engaging
and
organized
although
i
didn't
study
hard
for
this
class
and
i
feel
bad
for
it
i
have
lots
of
respect
for
this
professor
-----
everyone
has
their
you
need
to
go
to
nyu
for
this
professor
professor
guillory
is
mine
he
is
one
of
the
few
people
who
listens
to
understand
then
speaks
gently
and
helpfully
if
you
are
looking
for
the
best
professor
to
teach
you
about
literally
anything
just
take
one
class
with
him
you'll
be
all
the
better
person
for
doing
it
-----
john
david
guillory
is
a
true
gem
he's
the
kind
of
dude
who
you
want
to
be
friends
with
after
the
class
is
over
he
is
the
epitome
of
the
word
bro
the
course
itself
was
really
easy
and
he's
a
fair
grader
his
accessibility
for
feedback
is
admirable
as
is
his
passion
for
literature
take
this
guy
you
will
not
regret
it
-----
professor
guillory
is
very
smart
his
lectures
are
interesting
and
engaging
but
he
does
speak
in
a
monotone
his
tests
are
all
straightforward
if
you
go
to
lecture
and
study
the
major
texts
for
each
author
you'll
be
fine
-----
just
the
sweetest
man
his
lectures
were
so
engaging
very
organized
and
cohesive
used
the
proper
amount
of
history
and
anecdotes
to
keep
the
literature
interesting
very
clear
very
kind
very
helpful
ideal
for
a
survey
course
-
makes
the
cannon
way
cooler
than
it
actually
is
readings
can
be
very
dry
but
he
explains
why
they're
actually
great
-----
i
am
in
love
with
this
man
a
regular
britlit
heart-throb
if
you
go
to
lecture
and
do
the
reading
not
a
tough
work
load
you
will
do
fine
in
the
course
just
keep
in
mind
you
will
cry
when
it's
over
i
could
listen
to
guillory
recite
john
donne
to
me
forever
-----
i
have
to
admit
it
took
me
a
while
to
appreciate
him
but
he's
ace
incredibly
good
lectures
and
always
packed
full
of
information
despite
meandering
a
bit
i
hope
to
get
him
as
an
advisor
in
the
department
-----
i
wanted
so
badly
to
ask
him
out;
he's
so
cute
and
awkward
but
intelligent
and
charming
as
hell
his
lectures
are
freaking
brilliant:
such
original
theses
that
make
each
lecture
an
artful
essay
an
idiosyncratic
product
of
his
genius
whether
it
be
the
concept
of
scopophilia
wandering
or
sexual
ambiguity
so
interesting;
always
left
satisfied
-----
shakespeare
didn't
know
all
this
stuff
about
his
plays
this
man
is
dynamite
i
sure
wish
he
would
write
more
books
since
i
could
never
get
enough
of
his
lectures
-----
spellbinding
lectures
eye-opening
brilliant
and
wish
he
had
taught
more
undergrad
courses
so
i
could
learn
more
about
the
great
works
of
the
english
language
and
more
critically
how
they
came
to

britlit
i
--
i
was
interested
in
the
course
before
taking
it
i
love
the
topics
covered
but
his
lectures
were
incredibly
boring
everything
he
says
he
repeats
five
times
and
it
was
usually
obvious
to
start
with
it's
impossible
to
stay
awakeand
he
speaks
in
a
monotone
maybe
he's
okay
in
smaller
classes
but
he's
unbelievably
repetitive
-----
incredible
engaging
lecturer
never
a
dull
moment
very
approachable
and
open
to
questions
as
well
as
alternate
readings
of
material
-----
teaches
rarely
but
without
a
doubt
the
most
comprehensive
engaging
and
often
thrilling
overview
provided
by
an
undergraduate
survey
guillory's
lecture's
are
sharp
incisive
and
never
long
enough
absolutely
do
not
fail
to
seize
any
chance
to
hear
him
speak
[a
humble
superstar]
-----
amazing
professor
very
caring
and
teaches
you
everything
you
need
to
know
to
nail
a
job
her
class
should
be
required
for
every
student
-----
professor
white
is
the
sweetest
she's
just
a
good
person
let
alone
an
extremely
helpful
lecturer
i
went
into
this
class
knowing
most
of
the
materials
that
she
covered
but
i
still
learned
so
much
like
how
i
should
present
myself
in
a
professional
setting
she
gives
amazing
feedback
and
is
just
so
understanding
and
caring
-----
she
boosts
your
gpa
teaches
how
to
increase
the
probability
to
get
hired
and
most
importantly
teaches
you
how
to
love
your
professor
just
take
her
she
is
one
of
most
beautiful
smartest
and
caring
professors
in
my
whole
life
-----
this
is
a
very
easy
and
very
helpful
class
she
gives
really
good
clear
advice
and
backs
up
her
claims
with
good
logic
sometimes
she
is
very
late
on
giving
feedback
but
when
she
gets
there
it's
helpful
-----
professor
white
has
been
nothing
but
wonderful
taking
interviewing
strategies
has
been
one
of
the
best
decisions
ive
made
professor
white
takes
the
time
to
sit
down
with
each
student
and
go
over
their
resume
cover
letter
and
give
feedback
on
their
mock
interviews
i
highly
recommend
the
class
to
anyone
looking
to
prepare
for
life
after
college
-----
great
professor
great
help
on
my
resume
cover
letter
and
thank
you
note
you
will
get
an
a
if
you
do
what
she
asks
you
to
do
-----
i
wish
more
professors
would
follow
the
way
she
teaches
class
bc
she
cares
about
students&gives
portfolio
w
your
work
&
feedback
she
is
dedicated
and
is
clear
on
what
she
expects
from
everyone
for
a
two
credit
course
i
feel
like
it
is
a
lot
of
work
but
in
the
end
these
are
documents
that
you
will
eventually
need
to
write
when
looking
for
a
job
-----
she
is
the
nicest
teacher
ever
getting
an
a
in
this
class
is
easy
and
you
actually
learn
the
necessary
skills
you
will
need
for
a
job
interview
-----
really
was
the
most
useful
class
i've
ever
taken
the
class
isn't
necessarily
easy
instead
everything
that
is
required
is
laid
out
and
explained
follow
instructions
and
you'll
do
well
highly
recommended
professor
-----
professor
white
is
excellent
the
knowledge
i've
gained
from
this
class
is
invaluable
and
i
recommend
everyone
take
it
if
they
can
specifically
professor
white's
instruction
is
consistent
and
clear
and
she's
incredibly
encouraging
and
easy
to
approach
even
after
your
semester
with
her
has
ended
-----
i
can't
recommend
her
and
this
class
enough
you
learn
so
much
and
she
is
so
organized
and
thoughtful
that
she
sends
you
documents
after
class
with
recaps
so
you
have
this
info
forver
i
now
have
a
folder
full
of
amazing
career
advice
that
honestly
i
couldn't
find
anywhere
else
she
should
write
a
book
-----
by
far
the
most
useful
course
i
took
at
nyu
i
started
the
course
with
a
different
professor
who
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
so
i
switched
in
prof
white's
class
and
she
is
just
the
loveliest
most
thoughtful
professor
i
have
ever
had
she
gives
you
so
much
attention
i
often
wondered
how
she
did
it
i
recommend
this
class
to
everyone
at
nyu
-----
karen
white
is
the
best
her
class
will
actually
help
you
get
a
job
it
was
the
most
practical
applicable
to
the
professional
world
class
that
i
took
while
i
was
at
nyu
she
helped
me
so
much
i
had
zero
professional
experience
and
i
landed
an
awesome
job
three
months
after
graduation
i
would
not
have
gotten
it
without
prof
white's
guidance
-----
prof
white
is
an
amazing
professor
who
truly
cares
for
the
success
of
her
students
even
after
finishing
the
class
i
come
to
her
for
advice
and
she
always
makes
herself
available
to
advise
me
about
what
steps
i
can
take
in
the
interview
process
and
also
to
edit
documents
that
i
send
out
to
future
employers
the
tips
i've
learned
have
been
crucial
-----
she's
kind
of
useless
in
terms
of
materials
but
i
took
the
class
for
an
easy
a
and
i
got
it
she's
an
extremely
easy
grader
and
always
hands
out
extra
credit
however
i
wouldn't
recommend
her
if
you
want
to
actually
learn
how
to
interview
-----
she
is
amazing
even
in
a
big
class
she
gives
you
really
personalized
help
and
the
course
is
so
incredibly
practical
i
took
it
thinking
it
would
just
be
an
easy
a
and
it
was
easy
to
get
a
good
grade
but
i
was
overwhelmed
with
how
helpful
and
practical
the
course
is
she's
thoughtful
and
funny
and
really
willing
to
help
you
outside
of
class
-----
extremely
helpful
and
kind;
willing
to
help
you
out
on
everything
including
resume
cover
letter
thank
you
letter
recommendations
interviewing
and
anything
else
you
can
think
of
-----
great
guy
pretty
helpful
tippit
has
a
background
in
philosophy
and
really
appreciates
it
if
you
take
the
material
seriously
and
put
thought
into
your
work
if
you
take
history
of
economic
thought
try
to
be
engaged
in
the
class
-----
he
is
a
good
teacher
he
knows
what
he
is
doing
and
explains
everything
as
long
as
you
doing
the
work
you
will
be
fine
100%
you
will
learn
something
new
if
you
interested
in
the
subject
he
is
the
kind
of
teacher
to
take
-----
his
voice
is
very
small
but
if
you
sit
in
the
front
you
can
hear
him
clearly
he
tries
to
make
jokes
and
is
very
helpful
and
patient
some
of
his
test
questions
are
too
hard
but
he
curves
generously
overall
professor
tippit
is
one
of
the
best
econ
teachers
i
have
had
-----
very
monotone
60%
of
your
grade
depends
on
problem
sets
depending
on
the
course
grader
that
semester
you
may
or
may
not
be
happy
exams
were
difficult
gave
you
the
exam
beforehand
and
then
completely
changed
it
hw
is
key
to
passing
you
can
get
by
without
going
to
class
pop
quizzes
are
always
on
the
due
date
of
problem
set
take
for
easy
grade
-----
tippit
is
very
monotone
and
his
voices
tends
to
fade
out
at
the
end
of
his
sentences
when
he
is
stating
the
most
important
thing
in
his
slides
he
uses
power
points
so
he
lists
points
but
elaborates
on
them
if
you
can
keep
yourself
awake
then
take
him
he's
not
so
bad
-----
took
labor
with
him
he
knows
he's
boring
and
tries
but
its
a
technical
class
that's
expected
his
homework
assignments
were
pretty
difficult
but
they
are
worth
spending
time
on
use
his
lecture
slides
as
a
guide
if
you're
good
with
that
you
pretty
much
have
an
a
he
doesnot
care
too
much
about
his
students
but
the
class
itself
i
would
def
reco
-----
i
took
prof
tippit
for
io
and
labor
econ
this
past
semester
and
although
i
attended
each
and
every
class
in
hopes
of
getting
as
much
extra
credit
points
through
pop
quizzes
as
possible
they
were
really
boring
bring
a
laptop
homeworks
aren't
too
tough
know
the
topics
he
tells
you
to
know
for
the
finals
and
you'll
be
fine
-----
good
teacher
very
nice
and
clear
-----
he's
a
great
professor
he
knows
what
he
does
and
cares
about
his
students
the
subject
is
boring
you
have
to
keep
youself
busy
by
taking
good
notes
or
doing
something
else
in
order
to
stay
awake
-----
had
tippit
for
labor
economics
overall
he
is
a
fair
grader
lectures
are
not
mandatory
but
he
gives
pop
quizzes
once
in
a
while
that
count
towards
extra
credit
one
bad
thing
about
tippit
is
that
he
is
rather
monotone
it's
kind
of
hard
to
keep
focused
in
class
but
i
think
he
is
a
good
professor
-----
he
does
not
curve
the
grades
which
makes
it
really
tough
to
get
an
a
tests
were
confusing
and
the
final
exam
was
a
group
take-home
exam
-----
i
liked
the
prof
:
i
don't
really
remember
what
i
learned
during
both
lectures
labor
&
public
-
i
probably
slept
or
surfed
on
internet
but
i
thought
the
grades
were
pretty
fair
labor
was
very
easy
but
public's
exams
were
hard
and
unclear
overall
i
think
i
learned
something
from
the
class
as
we
had
to
really
know
the
stuffs
to
do
homeworks
-----
had
him
for
labor
and
public
econ
overall
both
classes
were
pretty
good
and
informative
he
goes
by
the
book
for
the
most
part
and
as
long
as
you
read
the
assignments
and
attend
lectures
you
should
be
fine
unless
you're
interested
in
the
subject
matter
you'd
find
these
classes
boring
no
matter
who
teaches
them
-----
awesome
professor
really
cares
about
his
students
and
takes
the
time
to
learn
their
names
though
the
lectures
are
kind
of
dry
since
he
goes
straight
from
the
book
it's
kind
of
unavoidable
and
he
definitely
admits
it
he
tries
to
make
class
interesting
and
is
very
helpful
during
office
hours
-----
good
teacher
the
final
exam
was
pretty
hard
but
he
gave
a
lot
of
opportunity
beforehand
to
work
and
rack
up
points
it
was
up
to
you
-----
one
of
the
worst
teachers
in
nyu
tricked
us
all
into
thinking
he
was
using
a
joke
of
a
grading
system
and
then
failed
everyone
on
their
final
exam
and
paper
noone
complained
how
bad
a
teacher
he
was
cause
we
all
thought
we
were
getting
a's
anyway
but
assignments
and
test
were
ext
difficult
very
difficult
very
unclear
and
very
boring
-----
i've
had
helen
twice
for
two
different
theatre
studies
classes
and
she
is
hilarious
and
a
really
great
teacher
she
engages
with
her
students
and
takes
their
thoughts
seriously
she
firmly
believes
in
reading
all
the
assigned
reading
above
anything
else
and
the
final
will
often
require
you
to
have
read
all
the
readings
-----
helen
is
incredible
she's
engaging
in
class
and
really
cares
about
the
subject
theater
she's
also
really
fun
one
of
our
assignments
was
to
write
and
perform
a
play
she's
also
super
accommodating
if
you
reach
out
and
put
in
effort
i
had
a
really
rough
semester
and
worked
with
her
to
delay
the
final
exam
and
finish
the
semester
off
well
-----
helen
is
amazing
she's
funny
and
smart
and
a
great
professor
to
take
to
warm
you
up
to
university
life
i
learned
so
much
in
this
class
she
does
go
on
the
occasional
tangent
but
don't
tune
them
out
because
there
is
valuable
information
in
there
-----
helen
is
literally
one
of
the
greatest
teachers
i've
had
though
she
does
give
a
lot
of
readings
she
is
an
amazing
teacher
very
passionate
and
thorough
about
her
work
and
also
conducts
tons
of
class
discussions
so
you
won't
ever
be
stuck
out
if
you
miss
if
you
miss
be
careful
because
she
does
cover
a
lot
in
class
also
she
is
sooo
funny
-----
i
took
helen
as
a
freshman
for
its
in
the
fall
and
she's
possibly
one
of
my
favorite
women
in
existence
she's
hilarious
and
made
the
8am
lively
she's
so
knowledgeable
in
her
subject
and
isn't
afraid
to
talk
about
issues
in
the
outside
theatre
world
the
readings
can
be
long
and
she
will
give
pop
quizzes
but
her
grading
isn't
actually
too
harsh
-----
i
have
helen
shaw
for
my
freshman
its
class
and
she
is
absolutely
amazing
her
lectures
are
always
so
interesting
and
her
jokes
make
the
class
super
enjoyable
the
reading
is
a
bit
killer
and
the
quizzes
can
be
a
bit
daunting
but
once
you
get
through
that
helen
shaw
is
absolutely
a
delight
i
love
her
-----
best
professor
ever
-----
massive
time
wasted
on
tortured
jokes
when
considering
the
amount
laid
out
for
nyu
bfa
students
the
return
should
be
quality
and
education
above
the
basic
level
-----
i
was
greatly
disappointed
too
many
self-adoring
jokes
at
the
expense
of
coverage
of
the
material
i
learned
very
little
and
had
to
re-live
high
school
a
kind
of
desperate
feeling
in
her
routine
low
on
rigor
-----
she
is
a
truly
hilarious
and
wonderful
and
brilliant
human
being
who
also
happens
to
look
a
little
like
emma
stone
she's
opened
me
up
to
a
lot
of
aspects
of
us
theatre
and
drama
that
i
hadn't
considered
before
her
class
is
a
joy
to
attend
just
to
get
her
insights
into
what
theatre
should
be
as
well
as
all
her
hilarious
asides
def
recommend
-----
one
of
the
best
teachers
that
i
have
had
at
nyu
from
the
first
day
of
class
you
will
just
want
to
be
her
friend
funny
intelligent
and
really
cares
about
her
students
as
well
as
theater
if
you
do
not
get
to
take
a
class
with
her
while
at
nyu
you
are
missing
out
-----
helen
shaw
is
one
of
the
sweetest
professors
she
is
also
very
funny
you
will
def
want
to
be
her
friend
very
knowledgable
of
her
subjects
loved
her
class
-----
i
promise
you
that
within
a
few
weeks
you
will
want
to
be
helen's
best
friend
she
is
so
hysterical
lots
of
reading
but
it's
the
kind
of
thing
you
can
wikipedia
she
makes
the
class
really
interesting
and
that's
great
considering
it's
not
the
greatest
subject
definitely
the
best
its
teacher
but
sign
up
for
her
as
soon
as
it
opens
seriously
-----
i
love
helen
shaw
it's
really
the
best
option
for
its
teachers
the
readings
she
assigns
can
be
long
sometimes
but
seriously
i
personally
wanted
to
do
every
night's
homework
the
readings
aren't
typical
they're
weird
and
her
lectures
are
hilarious
i'm
dying
in
her
class
because
it's
so
hilarious
take
helen
shaw
-----
a
wonderful
teacher
she
gives
a
lot
of
reading
that
for
the
most
part
you
don't
have
to
do
but
totally
worth
it
any
freshman
is
lucky
to
have
helen
for
its
-----
oh
my
gosh
if
you
are
taking
its
as
a
freshman
please
get
helen
this
year
was
her
first
year
teaching
this
course
but
she
actually
made
it
so
fun
she
is
literally
the
funniest
woman
i
have
ever
met
and
we
are
all
constantly
laughing
in
her
class
lots
of
work
but
honestly
it's
fine
the
fact
that
she
is
so
awesome
makes
it
not
matter

idisrespectful
and
completely
incompetent
if
you
want
to
express
your
opinion
his
answer
is:
i'm
the
professor
don't
argue
with
me
he
doesn't
remember
what
he
said
last
class
and
very
often
contradicts
himself
in
an
absurd
way
generally
he
is
a
disgrace
to
himself
and
to
nyu
and
should
have
retired
a
long
time
ago
-----
the
absolute
best
funny
kind
engaging
take
the
class
if
you
can
we
had
class
at
his
apartment
twice
and
went
to
spamalot
he
took
us
out
to
dinner
in
small
groups
plus
he
knows
his
stuff
and
the
class
was
very
interesting
nobody
understands
his
grading
but
that's
okay
most
definitely
take
this
class
if
you
can
-----
prof
serrin
is
the
best
i
turn
to
him
for
advice
constantly
his
past
students
have
come
back
to
talk
to
the
class
and
are
all
doing
amazing
things
in
journalism
-----
he
is
so
horrible
disrespecting
other
people's
cultures
always
intimidating
students
and
grade
our
assignment
according
to
his
mood
he
needs
to
learn
how
to
respect
others
before
he
teaches
in
nyu
btw
i'm
glad
that
he
will
retire
soon
for
the
sake
of
nyu
journalism
department
-----
how
come
a
well-respected
journalist
like
you
could
protect
professors
who
illegitimately
forbade
a
student
to
write
about
iraq
palestine
israelvietnam
and
withheld
grade
of
an
exclusive
story
about
conversation
between
a
vietnamese
journalist
and
henry
kissinger
i'm
extremely
disappointed
don't
hide
pls
all
is
under
the
light
of
conscience
-----
how
did
craig
wolff
make
you
refuse
to
hear
my
account
about
him
withhelding
my
grades
illegitimately
to
force
me
to
take
his
next
class
what
did
you
tell
mary
quigley
about
my
protest
against
wolff's
quid
pro
quo
harassment
so
she
created
a
hostile
academic
environment
against
me
good
journalist
don't
protect
harasser
and
discriminator
-----
by
far
the
best
teacher
and
best
class
i
have
ever
taken
serrin
is
a
dream
teacher
fun
projects
interesting
subject
material
plus
he
totally
runs
the
class
based
on
the
needs
of
the
students
on
top
of
everything
he
is
hilarious
and
laid
back
do
not
miss
the
chance
to
have
serrin
as
a
teacher
-----
professor
serrin
is
magical
he
makes
the
materiel
somehow
very
accessible
and
interesting
and
yet
still
challenging
and
this
is
essentially
an
american
history
course
that
counts
as
a
science
the
man
is
so
knowledgble
and
funny
and
interesting
and
he
wrote
the
textbook
so
he
knows
what
he's
doing
-----
nobody
should
go
through
the
nyu
journalism
program
without
taking
professor
serrin
he's
the
best
of
what
they
have
to
offer
period
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
ever
had
at
nyu
serrin
is
so
nice
and
laid-back
he
even
moved
class
to
ben
and
jerry's
for
free
cone
day
-----
probably
the
best
professor
i
had
at
nyu
i
took
two
of
his
classes
and
visited
him
in
his
office
frequently
for
advice
so
kind
and
so
helpful
and
very
accessible
unlike
a
lot
of
professors
here
-----
the
best
instructor
that
i
have
ever
had
at
any
level
-----
had
her
for
both
hap
and
maternity
she
is
fair
has
high
standards
and
is
a
very
good
professor
quite
a
few
people
have
issues
with
her
but
i
think
their
disapproval
stems
from
their
poor
performance
on
her
exams
in
both
courses
you
had
to
read
the
book
to
do
well
which
she
stated
multiple
times
fair
exams
fair
grader
quality
professor
-----
professor
jackson
is
clear
about
what
she
expects
from
her
students
but
she
seemed
to
have
lost
touch
she
is
unwilling
to
listen
to
ideas
and
change;
complete
brick
wall
and
hard
to
approach
it
was
not
an
enjoyable
experience
at
all
-----
prof
nj
does
talk
a
lot
about
he
family
stories
but
they
are
tied
in
with
what
she
is
teaching
if
you
come
to
class
and
pay
attention
and
take
notes
then
you
will
learn
a
lot
she
always
find
good
pictures
to
describe
the
topic
she
is
talking
about
so
pay
close
attention
the
you
will
do
fine
-----
one
of
the
best
teachers
i
have
every
had
yes
she
has
high
expectations
and
too
many
of
nyus'
nursing
students
think
they
pay
high
tuition
and
expect
to
be
spoon-fed
and
told
what
is
on
the
test
she
expects
students
to
study
and
is
always
available
to
those
who
want
to
put
in
the
effort
for
the
grade
-----
had
nvj
for
maternity
b
&
health
assessment
a-
and
if
you
work
hard
then
you
get
the
grade
that
you
deserve
very
generous
with
the
project
grade
to
help
you
pass
exams
are
hard
for
maternity
lab
quizzes
are
straight
out
of
the
textbook
&
unapproachable
outside
of
class
if
you're
lazy
then
you'll
definitely
fail
her
class
-----
jackson
does
not
care
about
students
she
doesnt
tell
you
what
to
study
and
wants
you
to
read
the
whole
book
and
tests
are
hard
very
specific
and
inclass
its
all
about
her
family
-----
seems
nice
in
class
but
mean
and
doesn't
care
about
students
if
you
talk
to
her
one-on-one
her
classes
aren't
helpful
and
just
her
telling
stories
but
she
takes
attendance
reading
the
text
is
a
must
because
that's
all
the
tests
are
on
good
luck
-----
one
of
the
worst
professors
i've
ever
had
mean
hard
and
doesn't
care
about
anyone
i
don't
know
why
she
hasn't
been
fired
yet
because
no
one
likes
her
maternity
should
not
have
been
that
hard
especially
since
her
lectures
are
based
around
her
stories
-----
she's
mean
and
very
unfriendly
she
doesnt
smile
or
display
any
motherly
like
qualities
her
tests
for
maternity
are
so
hard
and
unfair
-----
i've
had
health
assessment
and
maternity
w
professor
jackson
she
is
one
of
the
best
professors
in
the
nursing
department
she
is
humorous
clear
and
very
passionate
about
what
she
does
i
love
her
-----
don't
expect
too
many
smiles
from
her
she
is
very
hard
knows
her
stuff
but
is
fair
she
definitely
will
fail
you
if
she
must
even
if
you
are
a
tenth
of
a
point
from
passing
her
class
i
got
through
it
by
definitely
putting
in
the
time
and
effort
don't
let
a
bad
grade
on
her
exams
scare
you
there
is
room
with
lab
grades
and
papers
she
assigns
-----
she
is
not
the
nicest
professor
and
she
likes
to
tell
a
lot
of
stories
about
herself
as
a
mom
and
her
own
kids
she
does
not
get
to
the
pt
during
lecture
time
and
come
the
exam
she
gets
very
specific
not
a
good
professor
avoid
her
classes
if
you
can
-----
no
comments
-----
very
tough
but
fair
almost
overwhelming
amount
of
work
in
her
class
i
wouldn't
suggest
taking
this
class
with
another
clinical
or
class
with
heavy
coursload
-----
no
comments
-----
i
had
the
opportunity
to
take
professor
dee
for
the
financial
statement
analysis
course
offered
at
nyu
for
professional
studies
i
entered
class
with
familiarity
of
the
financial
statements
but
with
his
case
studies
and
homework
throughout
the
course
i
was
able
to
better
understand
the
material
i
highly
recommend
-----
loved
this
class
a
little
too
much
homework
which
was
hard
to
balance
work
family
life
and
class
work
but
i
got
it
done
but
he
was
very
responsive
when
asked
for
help
and
the
lectures
case
studies
were
interesting
and
he
explained
it
well
great
class
and
great
instructor
-----
he
tries
to
make
the
topic
as
comprehensive
as
possible
his
lectures
are
important
so
pay
close
attention
i
would
still
read
the
book
as
the
homework
are
based
on
the
content
of
the
book
i
really
appreciated
his
sharing
his
professional
experiences
to
topic
being
taught
-
brought
the
topic
to
life
-----
uses
real
world
case
studies
that
compliment
class
lectures
class
practice
exercise
were
helpful
when
doing
the
homework
-----
gave
great
clear
easier
to
understand
instruction
in
an
enjoyable
fashion
gave
good
real
world
case
studies
during
classes
highly
recommend
to
anyone
interested
in
financial
statement
analysis
-----
chris
dee
is
a
great
professor
very
approachable
explains
material
clearly
with
case
studies
and
real
life
examples
from
his
own
career
as
a
banker
he's
great
at
answering
questions
and
stays
after
class
to
answer
additional
questions
and
concerns
very
available
by
email
and
phone
outside
of
class
hw
and
case
studies
help
apply
material
-----
hands
down
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
ever
encountered
he
is
funny
knows
his
material
and
most
importantly
he
is
not
boring
his
class
is
not
the
type
of
class
you
will
dread
going
to
lots
of
homework
easy
but
time
consuming
he
doesn't
make
the
student
buy
expensive
textbook
mine
was
$11
on
amazon
-----
one
thing
i
can
say
is
that
if
you
want
to
learn
how
to
understand
and
implement
financial
statement
analysis
-
you
will
learn
financial
statement
analysis
with
professor
dee
professor
dee
was
really
clear
in
the
course
and
made
it
fun
with
interesting
examples
group
projects
and
class
assignments
the
home
work
he
had
us
focus
on
included
study
problems
which
lets
the
student
evaluate
each
company
differently
he
always
goes
straight
to
the
point
give
us
simple
and
complex
scenarios
to
prepare
us
for
the
real
world
and
really
has
you
thinking
outside
of
the
box
this
is
a
class
that
is
very
helpful
for
both
students
and
individuals
who
are
currently
in
the
financial
services
industry
it
opens
alot
of
dialogue
and
gives
alot
of
clarity
to
how
creditors
investors
and
analysts
view
financials
most
importantly
it
takes
a
good
professor
to
take
a
complex
subject
and
make
it
easy
for
the
student
to
understand
-professor
dee
did
exactly
that
-----
this
is
a
very
nuts
and
bolts
approach
to
financial
statement
analysis
you
need
to
do
and
think
about
this;
you
can
always
look
up
that
which
makes
it
different
from
classes
which
require
memorizing
material
that
will
eventually
be
forgotten
chris
is
very
accessible;
it's
clear
that
he
wants
students
to
understand
the
material
and
do
well
-----
chris
is
an
excellent
teacher
with
a
lot
of
real
world
experience
he
was
able
to
connect
the
relevant
concepts
from
the
textbook
to
incidents
and
scenarios
that
actually
occurred
for
someone
like
me
starting
out
in
the
credit
world
commercial
lending
it
was
extremely
helpful
to
have
a
teacher
like
chris
who
connected
all
the
dotsthanks
chris
-----
chris
was
excellent
-
simplified
concepts
and
pulled
out
only
relevant
information
repeated
to
ensure
key
concepts
were
emphasized
again
and
again
so
you
leave
knowing
the
important
things
accessible
added
personal
stories
to
put
things
in
a
real-world
context
highly
recommended
and
would
take
another
class
for
sure
with
him
-----
chris
was
a
teacher
who
managed
to
weed
out
the
relevant
from
the
not
relevant
as
it
pertains
to
the
real
working
world
he
was
very
clear
and
patient
-----
very
easy
and
comfortable
teacher
to
learn
from
he
manages
to
take
challenging
concepts
and
use
real
world
examples
to
make
them
understandable
additionally
he
made
understanding
the
creation
use
of
a
cash
flow
statement
exceptionally
easy
unlike
every
accounting
finance
course
i've
previously
experienced
i
highly
recommend
this
professor
-----
has
the
art
of
making
complicated
concepts
appear
simple
also
provides
a
context
around
the
subject
so
that
common
sense
is
developed
to
complement
practical
analysis
good
choice
of
book
great
sense
of
humour
funny
stories
wisdom
tips
based
on
blood
sweat
and
tears
made
even
financial
analysis
fun
to
learn
can't
ask
for
more
:-
-----
great
teacher
-----
no
-----
professor
ronell
delivers
the
most
mind
blowing
performative
lectures
her
readings
of
kafka
nietzsche
derrida
deleuze
heidegger
freud
and
others
opened
up
a
new
world
for
me
she
is
kind
honorable
funny
and
caring
i
highly
recommend
her
classes
-----
if
you
like
comparative
lit
you'll
love
avital
she's
inspiring
but
she
tends
to
talk
in
circles
and
goes
off
on
tangents
a
lot
she
doesn't
allow
computers
in
her
lectures
though
so
be
warned
-----
she
is
not
your
usual
type
of
professor
that's
for
sure
she
literally
performs
her
classes:
every
word
that
comes
from
her
mouth
is
pure
poetry
philosophy
not
everyone's
cup
of
tea
but
i
loved
her
-----
often
misunderstood:
in
class
she
is
not
only
teaching
the
subject
but
also
a
very
singular
conception
of
the
professor
and
of
the
philosophy
of
teaching
through
a
self-conceived
postmodern
performatic
method
that
makes
use
of
facial
gesture
body
language
and
vocal
expression
plus
sartorial
and
make-up
props:
a
truly
revolutionary
method
-----

-----
so
great
i
loved
watching
her
train
of
thought
and
went
out
of
my
way
to
take
another
class
with
her
this
semester
youtube
her
if
you
really
want
to
know
she's
on
there
-----
shes
great
smart
funny
and
very
challenging
-----
just
plain
awesome
but
never
plain
-----
she
is
one
of
the
most
important
scholar
thinker
alive
today
it
is
an
honor
to
learn
from
her
she
is
an
amazing
teacher
and
someone
who
can
teach
you
endlessly
about
yourself
and
the
world
-----
i
have
to
agree
with
some
of
the
criticism
here
incredibly
intelligent
seriously
-
very
sharp
but
if
you
want
to
witness
an
academic
cult
of
personality
at
its
most
grovelling
take
this
class
and
watch
how
people
who
disagree
with
the
professsor
there
must
be
other
poets
than
holderlin
and
rilke
to
examine
get
eviscerated
-----
anyone
who
brings
their
brain
to
her
is
lucky
to
be
alive
and
at
nyu
-----
her
class
was
teh
best
one
i
took
at
nyu
she's
brilliant
and
interesting
not
at
all
just
rote
versions
of
theory
she's
original
and
interesting
and
helpful
take
her
class
-----
sad
sad
case
she's
hopelessly
stuck
in
the
effete
pseudo-philosophical
theory
camp
of
decades
ago
can't
think
outside
rote
memorization
of
derrida
and
heidegger
ridiculously
pretentious
to
boot
study
with
a
serious
*scholar*
instead
-----
she
is
ridiculous
-----
prof
murray
is
a
great
caring
and
very
clear
professor
her
class
on
tv
history
was
super
interesting
and
the
test
given
are
directly
from
the
slide
shows
lectures
-----
her
lectures
are
really
useful
she
always
posts
them
the
readings
are
interesting
but
not
necessary
if
you
pay
attention
in
class
participation
will
definitely
give
you
a
boost
her
tests
are
very
straight
forward
and
aren't
difficult
her
syllabus
is
very
clear
on
how
and
what
she
is
grading
you
on
-----
prof
murray
is
very
knowledgable
and
her
lectures
are
really
interesting
heavier
on
readings
but
as
long
as
you
read
them
before
the
tests
you'll
be
fine
very
fair
grading
-----
knowledgeable
professor
the
material
lends
itself
to
dryness
because
much
of
it
is
a
repeat
of
material
studied
in
several
other
mcc
classes
not
a
demanding
course
if
you
stay
on
top
of
the
materials
and
screenings
i
enjoyed
the
class
her
structuring
of
the
class
and
her
dry
wit
-----
i
took
television
history
and
form
with
professor
murray
this
semester
she
is
a
good
professor
very
clear
a
bit
boring
at
times
but
overall
a
good
class
grading
is
done
in
a
very
straight
forward
manner
and
if
you
go
to
class
and
do
most
of
the
readings
screenings
you
will
get
a
good
grade
-----
she
is
a
very
fair
grader
and
all
assignments
are
fair
she
is
also
very
nice
and
helpful
it
was
her
first
time
teaching
amateur
media
she
knew
a
lot
but
often
her
knowledge
was
around
photography
the
class
was
kind
of
boring
and
the
articles
and
lectures
were
often
common
sense
or
dull
the
class
was
more
history
based
then
i
thought
-----
one
of
the
best
classes
profs
i've
had
at
nyu
-----
i
thought
this
would
be
an
fun
class
but
she's
quite
a
hard
ass
tons
of
reading
i
thought
the
focus
would
be
more
on
the
cultural
impact
but
it's
all
technical
and
about
rules
and
regulations
of
tv
i
kind
of
hate
this
class
-----
great
teacher
it's
a
fun
subject
and
she
is
organized
and
clear
about
what
she
requires
the
midterm
and
final
are
extremely
straightforward
just
do
the
readings
at
some
point
the
research
paper
is
work
but
the
fact
the
subject
matter
is
interesting
so
it
goes
by
fast
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
professor
and
class
-----
she's
very
nice
and
she
knows
what
she's
talking
about
make
sure
to
take
good
notes
bc
the
tests
rele
come
from
paying
attention
to
what
she
says
in
class
a
lot
of
rdgs
pretty
lecture
based
but
with
very
fun
enjoyable
tv
clips
she's
cool
-----
awesome
very
knowledgeable
has
a
clear
plan
of
where
she
wants
to
go
with
the
class
concentrates
a
lot
on
radio
in
the
beginning
so
expect
a
lot
of
historical
readings
very
good
about
answering
questions
and
clarifying
when
you
are
confused
highly
recommended
-----

-----
very
interesting
professor
very
nice
helpful
willing
to
work
with
you
available
to
students
not
a
difficult
professor
-
fair
normal
work
load
-----
really
really
easy
she's
nice

no
comments
-----
what
everyone
else
said
-----
this
guy
is
undoubtedly
the
worst
professor
in
the
world
i
cannot
believe
he
has
a
phd
let
alone
is
the
head
of
the
department
he
cannot
explain
even
basic
concepts
correctly
because
he
doesn't
know
them
it's
unbelievable
how
little
he
knows
about
even
the
basics
of
his
own
course
rambles
on
off
topic
for
the
simples
of
questions
unreal
-----
nothing
much
to
say
just
avoid
him
the
worst
professor
in
my
entire
life
no
question
-----
i
like
him
he
is
kind
of
funny
but
his
classes
are
terrible
the
whole
music
tech
program
is
a
messdont
enroll
in
this
program
-----
nyu
music
technology
is
led
by
him
and
it
is
chaotic
nowsomeone
needs
to
organize
it
-----
so
he
makes
you
choose
your
grade
at
the
end
of
the
term
even
if
you
do
all
the
work
participate
in
class
and
show
true
effort
in
obtaining
knowledge
in
the
subject
digital
audio
processing
you
still
only
get
a
b
while
kids
who
do
not
do
any
of
the
work
and
show
up
on
rare
occasions
also
get
a
b
not
fair
at
all
-----
i
think
it
would
be
safer
to
rate
the
professor
after
you
have
completed
one
or
two
courses
with
him
the
guy
knows
little
about
the
subject
while
it's
great
that
he
leaves
us
to
learn
on
our
own
he
should
also
be
there
when
we
have
questions
and
be
able
to
answer
them
correctly
not
to
mention
that
he
knows
little
about
the
subject
-----
he
takes
a
broad
educational
approach
in
his
teaching
which
is
exactly
what
a
department
head
should
do
he
also
has
some
people
skills
-
a
quality
often
lacking
in
the
music
tech
environs
-----
ugh
i
have
him
for
dap
i
and
ii
until
he
retires
good
luck
the
man
should
not
be
teaching
-----
no
comments
-----
i
took
two
courses
with
him
during
my
tenure
at
nyu:
electronic
music
syth
and
advanced
computer
music
composition
if
you
like
an
academic
approach
and
i
mean
that
in
the
truest
sense
to
composition
and
music
technology
than
you
will
probably
enjoy
his
classes
he
puts
you
in
a
box
that
forces
you
to
think
about
other
compositional
factors
i
enjoyed
his
classes
but
they
aren't
for
everyone
-----
dresses
and
acts
like
a
bad
used
car
salesman
nice
guy
though
--
head
of
my
department
saw
him
once
in
4
years
get
bishai
and
dubois
as
heads
and
you'll
have
a
real
deparment
-----
biggest
waste
of
$6k
in
my
life
-----
i'm
still
reeling
-----
at
first
a
bit
intimidating
because
he
does
expect
his
students
to
be
comfortable
with
all
prior
courses
he
does
however
create
extra
classes
where
you
can
ask
him
any
question
you
have
regarding
material
he
covered
or
personal
curiosity
they
are
very
helpful
grades
on
a
curve
with
40%
passing
absolutely
brilliant
guy
beautiful
lecture
notes
-----
european
scottish
professor
exams
are
given
european
style
40%
is
a
passing
score
curve
is
huge
explanations
are
very
clear
office
hours
are
very
very
helpful
he
uses
them
almost
as
an
extra
lecture
great
for
seeing
examples
worked
out
-----
take
him
if
you
can
he
is
extremely
helpful
and
a
phenomenal
teacher
he
always
has
good
explanations
for
everything
and
if
he
has
to
rush
somedays
he
is
more
than
willing
to
explain
to
you
everything
in
more
depth
either
via
email
of
after
class
-----
the
best
professor
i
have
ever
had
he
is
very
clear
with
his
explanations
and
is
just
brilliant
you
have
to
be
willing
to
work
hard
but
he
genuinely
cares
about
his
students
and
is
always
willing
to
help
go
to
office
hours
he
actually
made
me
love
maths
-----
great
professor
very
helpful
-----
one
of
my
favorite
professors
clear
lectures
with
a
lot
of
examples
that
were
consistent
with
his
tests
showed
interest
in
students
weekly
homework
but
not
too
much
weekly
quizzes
in
recitation
midterms
were
quite
long
uploads
lecture
notes
-----
he
comes
from
a
rigorous
education
system
so
he
expects
you
to
put
the
work
in
studying
midterm
i
was
insanely
tough
but
looking
back
over
it
very
fair
in
curving
office
hours
attendance
are
a
must
if
you
do
not
understand
material
end
class
curve
was
generous
he
really
makes
you
work
for
the
grade
but
you'll
thank
him
in
the
end
-----
he
hardly
ever
replies
to
emails
which
is
a
little
rude
and
frustrating
however
that
aside
his
lectures
were
great
and
he
is
extremely
helpful
tests
are
challenging
but
if
you
did
the
work
they
weren't
terribly
difficult
he
prepared
us
well
for
the
final
i
honestly
thought
i
hated
math
until
this
class
really
wonderful
instructor
overall
-----
his
tests
were
ridiculously
hard
but
he
reassures
his
students
that
although
a
grade
may
seem
bad
to
them
it
really
isn't
that
bad
and
he
really
helps
you
get
through
those
rough
times
plus
his
accent
and
his
hotness
really
helps
you
get
through
the
long
lectures
and
hard
tests
just
listen
to
his
scottish
accent
and
you'll
be
dazed
-----
nice
person
-----
okay
yes
he
expects
a
lot
of
prior
knowledge
but
he's
new
to
nyu
and
he's
got
high
standards
he's
very
approachable
and
definitely
cares
about
his
students
especially
if
you
put
the
effort
in
he
uploads
all
lecture
notes
and
is
very
in
depthspecific
with
the
topics
the
exams
are
very
difficult
but
i'm
sure
those
will
change
over
time
-----
he's
a
seriously
brilliant
guy
the
material
is
hard
and
a
lot
has
to
be
covered
quickly
but
he'll
help
you
if
you
take
the
time
to
ask
-----
has
high
standards
of
knowledge
on
mathematics
compared
to
other
professors
bc
he
is
originally
from
europe
expects
a
lot
of
detail
laughs
at
you
when
you
don't
understand
things
he
considers
to
be
basic
hard
to
reach;
doesn't
respond
to
emails
he
shares
his
lecture
notes
online
tests
and
hw
are
10x
harder
than
what
he
goes
over
in
class
-----
although
his
lectures
are
very
pointless
and
exams
are
very
hard
44
midterm
average
wo
curve
he's
hot
and
that
counts
-----
lectures
are
not
useful
at
all
make
you
doing
the
same
thing
repeating
repeating
repeating
on
same
thing
boring
do
not
follow
the
syllabus
schedule
have
no
clear
rubric
wont
take
his
class
again
-----
the
class
is
very
easy
we
watch
a
ton
of
movies
and
the
tests
are
open
note
with
the
questions
given
in
advance
definitely
a
good
class
to
take
if
you
are
trying
to
fulfill
a
map
requirement
so
happy
i
chose
this
one
-----
he
is
so
nice
he
is
so
funny
with
the
board
and
just
laughs
when
the
class
laughs
at
him
shows
a
lot
of
movies
--
a
good
way
to
learn
about
another
culture
=
-----
i
don't
know
why
this
guy
has
such
a
bad
reputation
the
class
is
easy
the
subject
matter
is
fairly
interesting
he
isn't
the
most
interesting
person
to
have
ever
lectured
but
he
makes
everything
easy
to
understand
it's
always
funny
trying
to
teach
him
how
to
use
the
smart
board
overall
he
may
not
be
excitingbut
he's
a
great
professor
-----
arvind
is
not
the
most
fun
but
he
is
still
very
good
he
tries
very
hard
in
making
the
long
readings
understandable
and
applicable
to
communication
studies
the
class
itself
is
quite
easy
and
he
is
to
blame
:
i
defenetly
recommend
him
for
future
hist
of
comm
people
the
subject
is
quite
boring
but
it
really
was
not
bad
at
all
-----
the
class
is
generally
easy
25%
of
it
is
participation
on
blackboard
you
gotta
read
the
book
articles
and
post
summarys
or
your
thoughts
on
them
if
you
remember
that
you'll
do
fine
on
the
midterm
and
final
you
gotta
do
an
essay
that
is
pretty
open
ended
not
bad
you
can
definetely
skip
the
class
half
the
time
and
pull
off
a
b
lectures=boring
-----
i've
heard
that
the
second
semester
version
of
the
class
is
easier
so
take
that
this
one
is
ok
but
its
all
politics
and
economy
-
no
culture
it
was
diwali
the
biggest
indian
holiday
in
class
one
day
and
he
didnt
even
acknowledge
it
-
thats
how
little
emphasis
was
on
culture
easy
grading

though
w
o
much
effort
you
can
get

rajagopal
is
the
nicest
prof
everbut
staring
at
a
pile
of
flour
would
be
more
exciting
easy
class
overwhelming
content
but
one
of
the
better
wc's
take
him
if
you
want
to
learn
more
about
india
but
expect
more
about
past
politics
than
modern
times
-----
go
to
class
and
pay
attention
and
make
a
decent
effort
to
read
the
books
and
you'll
do
fine
prof
raj
has
messy
handwriting
on
overheads
but
you'll
get
used
to
it
surprisingly
very
interesting
class
-----
nice
guy
good
teacher
easy
exams
-----
rajagopal
is
a
nice
guy
but
his
teaching
could
use
improvement
he
cares
a
lot
however
so
the
class
is
at
least
bearable
the
material
is
a
little
overwhelming
since
he
doesnt
explain
it
very
well
but
it
isnt
very
complex
go
take
notes
leave
and
dont
allow
yourself
to
get
frustrated
-----
fast
class
lots
of
notes
his
writing
is
illegible
-----
no
comments
-----
i
found
world
cultures:
india
to
be
interesting
but
very
frustrating
-
the
volume
of
the
material
we
were
responsible
for
was
overwhelming
and
while
i
did
well
in
the
course
it
was
a
very
stressful
experience
-----
writing
essay
lecture
showed
some
great
video
clips
really
interesting
lectures
even
though
they
would
sometimes
drag
very
friendly
and
overall
really
great
prof
-----
i
had
sheril
for
my
wte
lecture
portion
she
was
pretty
good
showed
us
some
great
clips
and
even
a
full
movie
she
made
us
laugh
sometimes
too
however
her
lectures
tended
to
drag
on
sometimes
and
some
of
the
topics
went
right
over
my
head
-----
she's
a
great
person
and
i
think
she
is
a
great
professor
although
people
may
take
her
for
granted
-----
i
took
her
anatomy
of
difference
for
upper
level
undergrads
and
grad
students
-
it
was
excellent
brilliant
-----
nice
teacher;
poor
lecturer
needs
to
give
more
information
than
what
was
already
read
in
the
textbook
-----
she
was
pretty
awesome
a
bit
boring
but
all
around
a
cool
teacher
-----
she's
so
into
herself
liked
talking
about
riefenstahl
and
dw
griffiths
then
said
oops
sorry
not
gonna
show
them
when
she
lectures
it's
like
she's
just
reading
from
the
****ing
book
because
she
probably
is

she
is
so
boring
and
basically
reads
out
of
the
text
book
if
i
wanted
an
audio
tape
of
a
book
i
would
have
bought
it
not
spending
my
valuable
time
and
money
in
her
class

pat
is
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
ever
taken
a
class
with
she
is
interesting
and
really
invested
in
every
one
of
her
students
if
you
can
take
any
class
with
her
i
highly
recommend
doing
so
-----
pat
comes
prepared
is
helpful
and
facilitates
disc
well
tell
her
if
you
want
more
discussion
don't
buy
every
single
book
if
you
just
need
one
story
contribute
to
class
even
if
it's
bogus
the
thing
is
that
this
requires
effort
this
is
no
easy
cas
course
you
will
read
you
will
write
you
will
complain
you
will
be
a
stronger
writer
for
it
-----
pat
is
fantastic
and
easily
one
of
the
best
teachers
i've
had
at
gallatin
i
thought
that
monsters
in
popular
culture
merely
looked
like
a
fun
class
to
take
over
summer
but
ended
up
learning
a
ton
of
information
theory
that's
been
instrumental
in
my
concentration
-----
patty
is
a
wonderful
woman
who
has
opened
my
eyes
to
a
world
of
wonderment
-----
this
class
is
fluffy
easy
fun
vampires
zombies
what's
not
to
like
right
unless
you
want
to
learn
something
twilight
movie
reviews
can't
teach
my
problem
with
this
prof
is
that
she
puts
on
airs
speaks
with
a
contrived
accent
and
is
condescending
to
students
although
in
this
way
that
seems
nice
very
into
herself
-----
i
just
finished
monsters
in
popular
culture
with
prof
lennoxand
i
loved
it
she
is
probably
my
favorite
gallatin
professor
so
far
i
love
that
she
is
also
open
to
giving
extra
time
for
papers
if
you
need
it;
i
wrote
one
of
my
best
papers
i
thought
because
i
had
a
few
extra
days
very
interesting
material
but
it
is
difficult
to
get
an
a
-----
good
selection
of
readings
and
flexible
with
paper
topics
however
she
is
unclear
about
assignment
and
overall
course
expectations
and
generally
unprepared
for
class
-----
i
took
her
monster's
in
popular
culture
class
as
well
as
her
shakespeare
course
she
is
one
of
the
best
teachers
in
gallatin
and
if
you
are
ready
to
work
you
will
exit
her
class
a
better
student
-----
pat
lennox
is
the
best
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
i
had
her
for
myths
and
fables
and
she
was
excellent
the
class
was
so
interesting
and
our
discussions
were
always
relevant
and
intellectually
stimulating
pat
has
also
been
extremely
helpful
to
me
for
networking
purposes
and
i
am
very
greatful
for
it
i
would
definitely
recommend
pat
and
m&f
-----
the
worst
professor
i
have
ever
had
i
have
not
learned
anything
about
the
subject
nor
writing
and
the
class
is
a
writing
seminar
class
discussions
rarely
ever
get
interesting
because
she
does
not
know
how
to
facilitate
them
seems
unprepared
for
class
and
even
wastes
time
talking
about
irrelevant
topics
to
fill
said
wasted
time
-----
sweet
lady
pretty
much
no
deadlinesshe's
very
flexible
with
paper
extensions
class
is
all
discussion
and
she
loves
hearing
everyone's
opinions
open
to
paper
topics
definitely
take
her
-----
amazing
this
is
one
of
the
best
classes
i've
ever
taken
i
believe
that
while
she
does
stray
on
tangents
they
are
all
for
reasons
you
can
use
any
one
of
those
'pointless'
tangents
in
your
paper
and
she
will
be
very
impressed
i
believe
she
knows
exactly
what
she
is
saying
when
she
says
it
no
time
is
ever
wasted
i
love
this
class
and
recom
it
-----
she's
sweet
but
wastes
way
too
much
time
talking
about
pointless
things
get
back
on
track
the
material
is
pretty
cool
though
and
what
you
write
about
is
very
open
-----
he
is
a
wonderful
smart
witty
and
good
old
fashioned
english
professor
who
truly
cares
about
the
text
s
and
the
student's
engagement
with
it
he's
very
business-oriented
but
he
will
stretch
you
wonderfully
no
easy
as
but
you
can
earn
them
with
hard
work
i
will
be
taking
him
again
in
the
fall
-----
you
must
take
one
class
with
him
before
you
graduate
from
nyu
if
not
you
would
have
wasted
your
education
here
he
is
very
organized
knowledgeable
humble
and
helpful
highly
recommended
for
those
who
really
want
to
push
themselves
but
not
recommended
for
people
seeking
easy
a's
for
a
particular
semester
because
you
really
have
to
work
hard
-----
archer
is
a
great
professor
very
helpful
his
lectures
are
long
but
funny
and
interesting
the
readings
for
the
most
part
aren't
too
bad
i
learned
a
lot
only
had
2
papers
during
the
class
and
most
of
them
were
short
and
had
detailed
prompts
he
gave
great
feedback
for
both
of
them
definitely
would
take
again
-----
archer
seems
like
a
good
person
even
a
very
good
person
no
doubt
he's
a
sweetheart
that
said
he
has
no
filter
whatsoever
and
can
be
one
hell
of
a
sharp-tongued
sob
he
has
no
patience
for
stupidity
and
does
not
hold
back
anything
some
of
the
stuff
that
comes
out
of
his
mouth
makes
me
think
wow
and
people
say
i'm
harsh
blunt
and
rude
-----
professor
archer
is
the
best
english
professor
at
nyu
i've
taken
by
far
out
of
7
he
is
everything
an
idealistic
professor
should
be
he's
knowledgeable
well-organized
genuinely
passionate
about
what
he
teaches
and
very
witty
at
times
i
recommend
his
class
i've
enjoyed
his
lectures
even
though
i'm
not
a
big
fan
of
shakespeare
-----
word
of
warning
this
guy
doesn't
suffer
fools
gladly
if
you
say
something
weird
or
awkward
in
class
he
might
be
pretty
cruel
-----
i
learned
a
lot
and
thought
he
was
always
well-prepared
and
interesting
-----
professor
archer
gives
interesting
lectures
and
is
clearly
passionate
about
the
subject
matter
he
often
runs
into
things
because
he's
excited
about
something
and
not
looking
where
he's
going
i
enjoy
hearing
his
perspectives
on
various
aspects
of
shakespeare
plus
the
ta
i
had
for
this
course
sarah
ostendorf
was
awesome
and
very
helpful
-----
john
archer
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
english
professors
at
nyu
particularly
great
for
those
who
love
shakespeare
renaissance
chaucer
hearing
him
read
in
middle
english
is
a
joy
otherwise
his
classes
are
always
very
informative
i've
had
him
twice
and
my
friend
has
taken
him
at
least
4
or
5
times
detailed
criticism
&
genuinely
helpful
-----
archer
is
a
very
smart
professor
who
knows
his
stuff
however
the
grading
was
terrible
because
of
the
ta
who
grades
100%
of
the
course
everyone
got
a
c-
to
b+
on
the
final
and
the
class
wasn't
even
curved
don't
take
this
class
unless
you're
willing
to
sacrifice
grades
for
an
interesting
topic
-----
fair
grading
exams
are
straightforward
passage
identification
with
one
or
two
tricky
excerpts
sparse
work
and
reading:
roughly
one
play
per
week
and
two
papers
and
exams
each
lectures
are
interesting
if
you
do
the
reading
-----
professor
archer
is
very
dry
dense
and
really
boring
only
shakespeare
fanatics
find
him
fun
take
him
if
you
love
shakespeare
otherwise
do
not
-----
professor
archer
is
genuinely
excited
by
shakespeare
he
always
seems
very
happy
to
be
teaching
yet
you
can
get
lost
when
he
starts
analyzing
the
different
plays
very
nice
and
very
intelligent
the
thing
that
will
make
or
break
your
grade
is
the
ta
you
have
-----
i
think
she
gives
great
feedback
and
the
class
will
help
your
writing
she
is
lovely
however
she
is
way
too
tough
when
it
comes
to
her
grading
i
would
spend
days
on
my
essay
and
go
to
the
writing
center
various
times
and
i
still
never
got
higher
than
a
b+
i
do
not
think
she
is
fair
with
grading
and
i
was
very
stressed
all
semester
-----
professor
souffrant
managed
to
make
a
class
that
i
thought
i
would
dread
as
a
first
year
freshman
into
one
of
the
most
valuable
and
interesting
at
times
classes
that
i
took
professor
souffrant
explains
tasks
and
assignments
clearly
and
her
assignments
can
be
challengingbut
she
is
willing
to
explain
any
questions
or
concerns
100%
recommend
-----
wte
is
just
one
of
those
annoying
classes
no
matter
the
professor
but
i
do
recommend
professor
souffrant
if
you
participate
and
show
up
to
class
you'll
be
fine
it's
mostly
time
for
brainstorming
for
content;
so
if
you
are
not
confident
in
your
writing
technique
i
would
recommend
seeing
her
for
office
hours
or
going
to
the
writing
center
-----
she
is
very
nice
and
helpful
during
class
make
sure
to
do
your
homework
and
the
assignments
are
a
lot
easier
she
spreads
work
out
over
a
long
period
of
time
-----
i've
never
thought
harder
about
the
color
blue
took
her
class
2
years
ago
and
am
still
so
grateful
for
all
i
learned
in
her
wte
class
really
easy
to
talk
to
during
essay
meetings
-----
im
about
to
graduate
nyu
and
none
of
the
classes
ive
taken
since
wte
with
souffrant
have
topped
her
class
if
you
do
the
work
and
ask
for
her
feedback
she
will
help
you
greatly
be
attentive
really
hear
her
-----
professor
souffrant
is
a
wonderful
teacher
who
is
very
accessible
within
and
outside
of
the
classroom
she
can
definitely
be
described
as
a
tough
grader
but
if
you
use
the
concepts
she
outlines
in
class
you
should
do
well
she
is
always
willing
to
go
over
past
work
she
expects
all
assignments
to
be
completed
so
be
prepared
for
a
lot
of
reading
-----
professor
souffrant
really
helped
me
to
strengthen
my
skills
as
a
writer
i
initially
struggled
with
the
course
but
after
meeting
with
her
i
improved
immensely
she
highly
encourages
unique
ideas
and
explorations
in
papers
the
course
is
very
challenging
but
incredibly
rewarding
if
you
utilize
both
the
writing
center
and
meetings
with
her
-----
very
tough
grader
good
teacher
but
somewhat
unclear
i
did
learn
a
lot
in
her
class
and
help
was
there
when
i
needed
it
-----
she
cares
about
her
students
and
will
offer
help
if
you
ask
for
it
her
clarity
is
iffy
but
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
a
writing
the
essay
thing
in
general
meeting
with
her
more
than
the
recommended
time
is
crucial
let
her
know
what
you're
trying
to
achieve
and
what
you
don't
understand
she
will
give
you
her
time
very
tough
grader
though
-----
she
made
the
class
surprisingly
enjoyable
i
feel
like
i
learned
a
lot
about
writing
especially
from
a
class
that
i
had
to
take
some
of
the
assignments
were
pretty
interesting
and
classes
were
different
shes
nice
and
seemed
to
really
care
about
helping
me
with
my
writing
i
recommend
this
teacher
-----
in
the
entire
semester
i
have
never
once
clearly
understood
what
she
actually
meant
when
spoke
she
always
gives
a
vague
idea
without
explaining
it
and
she
never
points
out
what
exactly
she
agrees
or
disagrees
with
a
student's
response
i
don't
think
i
have
improved
anything
to
make
matters
worse
my
writings
become
vague
thanks
to
her
-----
good
teacher
very
helpful
if
you
meet
with
her
wte
is
obviously
never
going
to
be
a
super
fun
class
but
i
liked
having
her
as
a
teacher
-----
nicole
is
a
really
sweet
person
she
cares
her
students
understand
them
and
most
importantly
she
prepared
class
material
and
revise
essays
really
carefully
can't
think
of
any
professor
better
than
her
-----
i
would
take
her
again
if
it
fit
in
my
schedule
shes
really
sweet
and
caring
i
would
definitely
recommend
her
in
my
opinion
she
could
be
a
little
unclear
in
what
she
wants
you
to
right
about
but
she
explains
it
if
you
dont
get
it
professor
callihans
class
isnt
terribly
difficult
if
you
can
id
say
take
her
class
-----
thank
you
for
being
my
teacher
-----
incredible
lady
super
sweet
knowledgeable
and
just
wants
everyone
to
learn
and
be
happy
great
experience
in
the
course
which
was
a
total
180
from
last
semester
the
environment
is
happy
supportive
and
i've
learned
so
much
more
from
her
than
i
did
last
semester
-----
professor
callihan
is
an
amazing
expository
writing
teacher
who
cares
for
her
students
not
only
is
she
understanding
of
your
situation
but
also
she
really
wants
you
to
improve
your
writing
skills
i
have
always
found
her
critiques
clear
she
also
offers
many
one-to-one
conferences
-----
professor
callihan
is
the
perfect
expos
instructor
if
you
are
an
intellectually
curious
person
who
wants
to
explore
the
surrounding
world
she
always
has
such
a
profound
presence
in
the
class
and
her
ideas
are
extraordinary
truly
inspiring
-----
professor
callihan
is
always
so
nice
and
full
of
amazing
ideas
she
inspires
her
students
a
lot
and
really
cares
and
listens
to
her
students
expos
will
be
fun
with
her
i
promise
-----
prof
callihan
is
definitely
a
nice
lady
but
if
you've
struggled
with
english
and
writing
in
high
school
i
don't
think
her
class
would
be
the
best
for
you
her
style
of
teaching
and
grading
was
very
difficult
for
me
so
the
class
was
a
bit
overwhelming
and
a
tad
unenjoyable
since
i
was
never
a
great
writer
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
ever
had
she's
very
kind
and
energetic
i
looked
forward
to
her
class
and
when
it
comes
to
conferences
she
gives
useful
feedback
and
advice
with
how
to
write
your
essay
she
makes
writing
enjoyable
and
she
is
such
a
wonderful
person
i
definitely
recommend
to
take
her
class
-----
professor
callihan
is
a
great
professor
she
really
cares
about
you
and
wants
you
to
succeed
so
if
you're
having
trouble
all
you
have
to
do
is
go
visit
her
and
she
will
try
and
guide
you
professor
callihan
is
a
great
writing
professor
and
she
knows
that
we
are
engineering
students
so
she
does
a
lot
for
her
students
-----
not
only
is
she
an
outstanding
teacher
prof
callihan
is
a
very
nice
person
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
she
is
always
willing
to
help
out
as
long
as
you
go
to
class
there's
no
reason
to
miss
her
class:
you
will
always
learn
something
and
have
a
great
time
and
someday
she
might
even
bring
cookies
madeleines
-----
wonderful
teacher;
she
is
helpful
friendly
and
pretty
good
at
explaining
things
-----
love
professor
callihan
she's
a
star
tough
grader
but
she
wants
you
to
do
well
and
tries
her
best
to
get
you
on
the
right
track
and
she
brings
cupcakes
to
class
sometimes
-----
terrible
teacher
she
thinks
she
is
the
best
thing
since
sliced
bread
she
also
talks
down
to
you
if
you
are
taking
her
class
anywhere
besides
at
princeton
if
you
want
help
don't
bother
she
won't
answer
any
questions
yet
degrades
you
for
not
knowing
the
answer
avoid
this
teacher
-----
extremely
dismissive
narcissistic
critical
the
material
itself
is
very
interesting
but
don't
plan
on
getting
an
a
-----
you
have
to
work
hard
in
her
class
and
be
willing
to
take
constructive
criticism
she
doesn't
spoon-feed
which
really
is
a
plus
because
it
motivates
you
to
analyze
her
assigned
readings
don't
take
her
class
if
you
want
an
easy
a
or
are
used
to
getting
it
take
it
if
you
really
want
to
learn
about
the
foundational
theories
of
social
psych
-----
stacey
could
not
have
done
a
better
job
at
teaching
this
material
true
she's
a
bit
funky
-
but
that's
irrelevant
to
her
teaching
and
furthermore
i
liked
it
organized
smart
clear
fair
and
i
personally
looked
forward
to
seeing
each
wardrobe
she
chose
for
the
day
i
found
her
to
be
relatable
and
made
the
class
interesting
-----
tends
to
be
dismissive
uninterested
toward
legitimate
responses
from
students
both
in
classroom
discussion
and
graded
items
exams
essays
--
interpreting
student
opinions
in
an
unnecessarily
negative
light
or
simply
flagging
them
as
irrelevant
extremely
high
estimate
of
own
opinion
unapproachable
unless
one
defers
entirely
to
her
authority
-----
i
like
her
very
much
extremely
logical
structured
and
smart
very
good
at
explaining
complex
concepts
and
is
clearly
well-read
and
knowledgeable
in
her
field
and
beyond
is
forthcoming
but
not
intimidating-i
am
sick
of
professors
who
try
to
be
nice
nodding
delightfully
at
silly
comments
in
class
has
a
quirky
personality
which
is
great
too
-----
the
lutz
should
be
avoided
at
all
costs
she
comes
off
kind
of
snobby
and
once
every
class
session
she
will
stomp
out
into
the
hall
and
yell
at
someone
for
being
too
noisy
loves
her
own
voice
often
times
will
discount
students'
opinions
without
giving
a
good
explanation
as
to
why
they
are
wrong
sometimes
when
the
student
is
officially
correct
-----
i
took
her
psychology
of
social
behavior
for
the
general
ma
program
she
was
unapproachable
unkind
and
only
applauded
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
in
the
classroom
i
suggest
that
you
take
anyone
else
and
professor
lutz
i
suggest
you
aspire
to
impart
knowledge
to
your
students
not
just
engage
us
in
two
hours
of
self-love
-----
tedious
professor
who
created
the
literally
most
deadening
environment
in
class
i
have
ever
experienced
very
unhelpful
too
and
narcissistic
to
finally
finish
this
class
felt
like
being
released
from
prison
-----
bad
teacher
and
stultifying
environment
don't
take
this
course
-----
avoid
this
class
-
tedious
teacher
and
unhelpful
especially
with
grades
-----
i
had
prof
lutz
for
developmental
and
social
psychology
courses
a
great
teacher
-
thorough
pleasant
intelligent
able
to
present
complex
information
very
concisely
an
absolute
joy
to
go
to
class
assignments
were
two
papers
and
three
tests
-----
took
intro
to
digital
media
last
semester
class
was
very
interesting
he
did
a
good
job
in
presenting
different
viewpoints
and
keeping
me
interested
throughout
the
semester
class
blog
was
also
useful
-----
this
was
the
worst
class
i
have
ever
taken
completely
based
on
class
presentations
which
get
old
and
everyone
played
on
their
laptops
the
entire
time
the
concepts
are
hard
but
even
so
a
complete
waste
of
time
-----
he
is
a
really
great
guy
and
i
didnts
mind
attending
class
but
be
aware
that
it
is
all
take
home
essay
tests
and
he
is
a
hard
grader
that
expects
abstract
connections
not
simply
given
to
you
in
class
-----
hey
this
was
a
good
class
maybe
not
the
easiest
but
i
learned
a
lot
from
it
take
him
you
won't
regret
it
-----
i
took
intro
to
human
comm
and
culture
with
marco
i
the
readings
he
assigned
the
way
he
taught
the
class
the
way
he
graded
my
friend
recommended
this
course
saying
she
loved
it
and
it
was
one
of
her
easiest
class
he
grades
very
hard
which
is
unfair
because
he
doesnt
even
teach
the
abstract
material
well
at
all
his
curriculum
is
very
obscure
-----
marco
is
a
young
and
brilliant
professor
the
readings
he
assigns
are
a
bit
hard
but
then
he
spends
time
in
class
trying
to
make
them
accessible
overall
this
class
was
interesting
and
i
learned
a
lot
from
it
-----
ta
for
siva's
last
semester
at
nyu;
class
was
great
if
you
did
the
readings
posted
on
blackboard
no
books
to
buy
marco's
a
little
difficult
to
understand
and
his
ppt
notes
are
not
sufficient
to
answer
the
final
exam
questions
little
slow
with
returning
grades
-----
highly
recommend
him
-----
marco
is
very
attractive

his

there
aren't
many
distinguishing
factors

than
these

marco
was
a
great
teacher
prepared
helpful
sometimes
even
funny
i
recommend
him
to
anybody
-----
once
you
get
past
the
way
he
pronnounces
things
he
is
a
great
ta
and
he
is
not
too
bad
to
look
at
either
-----
is
she
a
rep
for
the
cdc
that's
all
she
seems
to
reference
i
guess
the
point
of
nursing
school
is
to
memorize
cdc
recommendations
and
not
think
for
yourself
-
since
after
all
everything
requires
a
specialist
and
the
cdc's
transparent
and
reliable
studies
-----
perfect
combination
of
gravitas
wit
and
charm
-----
totally
agree
with
the
previous
comment
she
does
not
prep
you
at
all
for
her
exam
-----
mccabe
knows
her
stuff;
that
being
said
she
does
not
teach
for
the
exam
at
all
she
is
perhaps
the
most
vague
professor
i've
had
and
expects
you
to
figure
certain
things
out
she'll
give
you
all
the
interventions
for
a
disease
and
will
not
rank
importance
on
the
test
all
the
interventions
are
listed
and
you
better
know
which
one
comes
first
-----
if
you
do
the
reading
come
to
class
take
good
notes
and
review
the
podcasts
as
needed
you
will
be
fine
dr
mccabe
is
the
perfect
combination
of
engaging
compassionate
tough
and
direct
she
really
does
care
about
students
and
the
material
she
is
teaching
and
that's
what
helped
me
come
prepared
-----
i
love
dr
mccabe
she
can
come
off
as
kind
of
blunt
in
class
but
if
you
meet
with
her
individually
she's
amazingly
compassionate
understanding
helpful
etc
she
was
also
a
really
good
lecturer
-----
not
bad
podcasts
everything
info
needed
for
tests
is
mainly
in
the
powerpoints
-----
made
the
class
tolerable:
mauro
alone
would
have
been
a
nightmare
-----
dr
mccabe
is
the
best
professor
i've
had
in
nyucn
she
has
a
lot
of
experience
especially
in
geriatric
nursing
to
share
and
keeps
the
material
engaging
she
is
very
helpful
encouraging
and
clear
i
wish
i
had
her
as
a
clinical
instructor
too
as
i've
heard
nothing
but
great
things
about
her
in
that
position
needless
to
say
highly
recommended
-----
she
was
awesome
she
expects
you
do
to
your
work
but
test
come
from
her
notes
and
the
book
the
best
professor
i
had
at
nyu
-----
organized
clear
and
approachable
the
content
is
the
content
and
is
the
basis
of
exams
textbook
reading
a
must
but
professor
mccabe
does
her
best
to
make
it
clear
and
interesting
-----
i
think
she's
an
awesome
professor
very
helpful
and
really
knows
her
stuff
i
would
recommend
her
to
anyone
-----
great
lecturer
accessible
outside
of
teaching
hours
gives
good
feedback
to
assignments
-----
took
his
linear
algebra
this
semester
it's
his
first
time
teaching
the
subject
so
the
class
is
pretty
boring
and
it's
also
his
last
semester
here
in
nyu
cuz
he's
said
to
go
back
to
australia
next
year
given
that
he
behaves
very
irresponsible
he
canceled
class
several
times
and
sometimes
don't
reply
to
email
or
just
not
helpful
at
all
-----
he
teaches
using
examples
of
what
not
to
do
he
is
not
clear
at
all
i
didnt
attend
lecturs
after
the
first
2
weeks
becuase
i
knew
id
be
better
off
learning
it
on
my
own
-----
focused
more
on
what
we
shouldnt
do
rather
than
what
to
do
he
taught
through
proofs
he
spent
the
last
review
session
teaching
us
things
we
didnt
need
to
know
instead
of
helping
us
review
for
the
final
i
emailed
him
multiple
times
during
the
semester
and
only
got
a
reply
once
he
never
fully
answers
questions
not
even
the
easy
ones
-----
if
he
would
focus
his
efforts
on
trying
to
teach
better
instead
of
trying
to
be
humorous
he
would
be
a
great
professor
teaches
concepts
through
proofs
but
rarely
gives
helpful
example
problems
those
who
do
well
seemed
to
do
so
through
a
prior
knowledge
of
calculus
not
due
to
what
was
taught
-----
he's
likable
but
he
doesn't
teach
well
most
of
the
time
he
seems
pretty
confused
himself
and
takes
all
of
these
times
on
proofs
that
you
don't
really
need
to
know
also
he
doesn't
respond
to
emails
but
he
is
funny
or
tries
and
from
what
i've
heard
about
other
calc1
professors
at
the
school
he's
better
than
most
-----
his
accent
complimented
with
his
incomprehensible
proofs
that
lead
in
circles
right
back
to
confusion
create
an
atmosphere
comparable
to
hell
itself
that
man
is
the
devil
he
just
hides
his
tail
in
his
pants
-----
his
lengthy
proofs
and
examples
of
how
not
to
do
problems
confuse
people
who
are
simply
trying
to
learn
how
to
do
calculus
in
the
first
place
but
if
you
know
calculus
already
there's
no
reason
not
to
take
him
he's
cool
for
the
most
part;
young;
sociable
-----
probably
the
most
useless
math
teacher
i
have
ever
had
i
wanted
to
be
a
math
major
before
i
took
his
class
and
don't
get
it
confused
i
pay
attention
i
sit
in
the
front
this
man
is
not
a
very
good
explainer
he
acts
like
we
are
all
as
smart
as
him
and
know
what
he
is
talking
about
he
doesnt
explain
things
very
well
and
skips
over
some
things
-----
this
fool
is
amazing
nuf
said
-----
harvey
is
thourough
and
reasonable
the
people
who
don't
understand
what
is
going
on
in
lecture
are
ones
who
talk
and
dont
pay
attention
about
answering
question
people
ask
retarded
questions
and
im
not
particularly
good
at
mathlol
i
didn't
pass
ap
calc
but
i
really
enjoy
his
class
and
really
enjoy
calc
nowwoot
-----
when
students
have
questions
he
typically
does
not
answer
in
a
way
that
helps
students
understand
the
material
he
has
notes
on
a
sheet
that
he
just
copies
on
to
the
board
as
quickly
as
possible
so
he
can
get
through
the
lesson
for
the
day
his
handwriting
is
utterly
abysmal
sometimes
his
class
just
ends
up
frustrating
me
by
the
end
of
it
-----
professor
caspary
is
the
sweetest
man
i
ever
met
you
will
sit
in
a
diner
with
him
to
chat
for
one-on-one
meetings
which
seems
strange
but
is
actually
eyeopening
he
genuinely
cares
about
his
students
and
their
interests
however
his
readings
are
unrealistic
and
class
lectures
can
be
drag
he
grades
harshly
but
guaranteed
a
min
b
in
the
class
-----
wonderful
professor
and
wonderful
class
could
not
have
thanked
professor
caspary
enough
for
providing
me
a
better
understanding
of
what
i
would
like
to
study
inspiring
and
truly
a
clear
example
of
what
a
professor
should
be
incredibly
caring
and
understanding
yet
challenges
you
to
a
greater
understanding
-----
bill
is
one
of
the
most
amazing
professors
at
nyu
he's
soulful
kind
passionate
and
a
witty
man
he
truly
cares
about
his
students
and
their
lives
and
gets
to
know
all
of
them
personally
hugely
important
to
my
academic
life
lectures
can
be
a
bit
long
and
at
times
a
bit
tedious
but
the
process
of
learning
is
worth
it
he's
a
mentor
-----
truly
representative
of
what
an
educator
should
be
i
am
grateful
i
had
the
opportunity
to
take
a
course
with
such
and
endearing
and
brilliant
man
i
could
not
recommend
professor
caspary
enough
if
you're
reading
this
thank
you
-----
caspary
is
a
sweet
man
who
doesn't
care
about
grades
this
can
be
a
good
or
bad
thing
attendance
doesn't
matter
his
feedback
is
very
broad
and
his
grading
is
not
clear
at
all
caspary
expects
you
to
regurgitate
what
he
says
in
your
papers
very
ironic
given
what
he
says
in
class
about
education
and
i
regret
taking
this
class
don't
take
-----
i
rarely
write
reviews
but
bill
changed
my
life
an
incredible
professor
and
an
even
more
wonderful
soul
this
class
made
me
a
more
decent
human
being
-----
truly
an
amazing
person
take
one
of
his
classes
just
so
you
can
confirm
that
good
and
passionate
people
exist
very
helpful
enthusiastic
intelligent
and
welcoming

bill
is
endearing
and
very
enthusiastic
about
what
he
teaches
i've
found
though
that
he
seems
to
be
one
of
those
professors
who
feels
their
academic
opinions
interpretations
are
fact
so
if
you
disagree
with
him
it
might
cause
some
tension
alsohe's
just
so
old
at
this
point
that
you
can
never
really
tell
what's
going
on
in
that
head
of
his
-----
simply
great
class
great
professor
and
great
man
thought-provoking
informative
and
clear
expansive
knowledge
of
ethics
and
american
politics;
especially
dewey
and
the
movers
and
shakers
of
democratic
theory
and
practice
if
cynical
blinkered
conservatism
or
w
f
buckley
floats
your
boat
you
might
have
difficulty
squaring
with
each
other
-----
i
never
write
these
things
but
i
had
to
for
bill
i
had
him
for
creative
democracy
incredibly
bright
incredibly
informative
and
a
deeply
caring
individual
i
wish
he
taught
all
of
my
classes
it
is
truly
an
honor
to
have
such
a
wonderful
person
in
my
life
-----
i
had
bill
for
creative
democracy:
the
pragmatic
tradition
this
man
is
absolutely
inspiring
and
thoughtful
he
expects
you
to
think
in
class
and
challenges
you
to
apply
what
you
learn
a
wonderful
professor
with
a
caring
soul
-----
i
took
pearl's
class
three
years
ago
and
i
still
refer
to
the
methodology
i've
developed
in
her
class
i
regularly
bring
up
the
insightful
points
we
made
in
her
class
on
derrida
butler
and
baldwin
in
my
classes
today
and
many
professors
are
impressed
when
i
say
i
read
the
text
in
freshman
year
100%
recommend
you
will
not
regret
the
tough
class
-----
she
is
the
best
professor
i've
ever
had
very
intelligent
very
knowledgeable
respect
every
opinion
sometimes
i
wish
i
could
be
as
cool
and
amazing
as
she
is
although
she
is
a
tough
grader
but
you
can
definitely
learn
a
lot
in
her
class
-----
pearl
was
my
favorite
part
of
paris
she
taught
me
so
much
she
tells
funny
stories
and
is
great
at
explaining
difficult
theory
she
makes
you
work
for
it
but
it
is
so
worth
it
-----
pearl
is
the
best
professor
i've
ever
had
she
might
be
the
smartest
person
i
know
and
changed
the
way
i
read
write
and
think
the
hardest
class
i've
taken
but
she
pushes
you
so
you'll
get
better
it's
also
really
rewarding
participate
in
class
and
take
peer
editing
seriously
work
hard
and
it
will
be
worth
it
-----
pearl
is
one
of
the
greatest
teachers
i've
had
so
far
she
keeps
it
very
real
and
is
always
down
to
talk
about
social
issues
she
pushes
you
very
hard
but
mostly
because
she
wants
you
to
get
better
i
would
take
her
class
again
even
though
it's
very
challenging
lots
of
reading
lots
of
writing
it's
hard
to
slack
off
-----
professor
pearl
is
one
of
my
favorite
nyu
professors
so
far
she's
interesting
funny
and
always
gives
everyone
a
chance
to
express
their
opinion
the
reading
she
assigns
really
makes
you
think
i
was
expecting
a
typical
writing
class
but
it
was
so
much
more
than
that;
you
learn
a
lot
about
society
philosophy
and
culture
100%
recommend
-----
this
professor
seriously
changed
my
view
on
writing
and
academics
as
a
whole
i
was
barely
into
the
first
semester
and
i
could
already
tell
how
much
better
my
writing
was
it's
not
an
easy
class;
you
definitely
have
to
work
for
your
grade
however
if
you
put
in
the
work
you'll
get
amazing
results
taught
me
so
much
about
writing
and
our
world
-----
take
professor
pearl
if
you
want
to
become
a
better
writer
and
have
your
perception
of
the
world
changed
forever
she
gives
you
a
lot
of
texts
to
read
some
which
are
very
dense
but
her
lectures
are
worth
it
and
very
interesting
she
can
be
somewhat
intimidating
but
she
is
hilarious
and
helpful
you
have
to
work
hard
for
an
a
but
it's
worth
it
-----
still
to
this
day
the
best
professor
i've
had
she
chooses
mind-bending
texts
that
challenge
and
shift
your
perception
of
the
world
you
walk
out
of
the
class
knowing
that
you
learned
something
i
discovered
a
passion
for
semiotics
and
gender
studies
which
i
was
unaware
of
prior
to
taking
the
class
i
still
write
on
these
topics
in
my
classes
now
-----
professor
pearl
is
an
incredibly
smart
professor
and
passionate
about
what
she
teaches
she
wrote
her
dissertation
on
the
texts
we
read
in
class
be
prepared
to
work
outside
of
class
but
i
enjoyed
every
class
session
due
to
her
hilarious
personality
and
willingness
to
go
into
as
much
depth
as
you
need
really
interesting
course
material
as
well
-----
uses
a
great
list
of
essays
that
challenges
students
to
deconstruct
social
constructions
and
develop
writing
habits
kind
and
quiet
she
is
a
helpful
editor
and
tells
hilarious
stories
but
for
both
you
need
to
ask
the
professor
respects
her
students'
intelligence
and
ability
so
will
also
assume
your
understanding
if
you
don't
demand
help
-----
kind
and
compassionate
professor
tough
grader
pearl
integrates
compelling
philosophical
content
into
her
assignments
this
is
a
writing
class
where
you
might
actually
learn
something
i
highly
recommend
it
-----
very
theoretical
even
though
this
is
a
writing
class
we
used
philosophical
and
theoretical
texts
in
your
essays
some
topics
covered
this
year
were
race
gender
forgiveness
and
cosmopolitanism
very
funny
and
willing
to
help
i
would
recommend
her
to
anyone
looking
for
a
bit
of
a
challenge
-----
i
had
her
mideast
class
in
summer
2009
it
was
great
for
a
3
hour
class
she
really
kept
us
interested
and
her
examples
were
always
great
it
was
a
lot
of
work
but
well
worth
it
i
wish
they
offer
more
classes
like
hers
during
the
year
-----
she
was
extremely
smart
prepared
when
i
had
her
for
a
middle
eastern
course
in
the
spring
of
2002
felt
lucky
to
have
her
a
time
when
the
course
was
so
topical
it
must
be
noted
that
was
without
question
the
hottest
professor
at
the
college
-----
friendly
professor
good
grasp
of
the
issues
read
the
textbook
and
she'll
tell
you
what
she's
looking
for
in
the
writing
-----
had
her
at
fordham
she
was
an
excellent
professor
with
a
combination
of
material
mastery
and
a
great
ability
to
convey
it
in
an
understandable
manner
also
extremely
hot
-----
the
lectures
were
fast
and
the
class
was
challenging
but
worthwhile
-----
top
notch
prof
marji
is
an
engaging
lecturer
and
she
has
the
best
smile
of
any
professor
i've
ever
had
i
loved
the
class
-----
if
you're
interested
about
gaining
valuable
insight
into
the
middle
east
then
this
is
a
great
class
lots
of
reading
but
exam
questions
were
so
open
ended
that
you
could
really
write
about
one
or
two
books
and
leave
it
at
that
and
on
a
less
serious
note
she's
quite
attractive
-----
not
only
is
she
a
professor
but
she's
an
underegrad
advisor
too
-----
no
comments
-----
one
of
the
best
teachers
i
had
all
four
years
ask
her
for
help
with
anything
and
she
is
there
for
you
you
just
need
to
be
willing
to
learn
-----
not
great
-----
the
course
material
is
interesting
but
this
class
is
very
challenging
you
need
to
attend
every
lecture
and
take
good
notes
or
record
the
lecture
to
do
well
prof
davachi
lectures
very
fast
so
you
need
to
pay
attention
the
textbook
is
useless
there
are
three
exams
but
only
the
best
two
counts
there
are
also
a
final
and
a
literature
critique
-----
lila
is
extremely
condescending
in
class
the
class
is
extremely
boring
in
the
first
half
of
the
semester
because
though
it
is
an
advanced
psych
class
we
go
over
basic
neuro
bio
there
is
a
20
point
essay
on
the
exams
that
comes
from
articles
read
in
recitations
which
she
kindly
failed
to
mention
recitation
is
mandatory
but
pointless
-----
davachi
was
extremely
clear
in
her
lectures
as
well
as
interesting
i
never
missed
a
lecture
because
i
enjoyed
them
so
much
but
the
class
is
hard;
you
have
to
study
the
textbook
is
a
good
reference
but
useless
otherwise
ta
told
me
that
they
don't
write
own
multichoice
the
mc
are
really
difficult
on
exams
but
not
impossible
to
get
an
a
-----
first
of
all
don't
buy
the
text
book
okay
this
is
a
rough
class
not
gonna
lie
about
that
one
however
i
started
recording
the
lectures
which
i've
never
done
my
entire
3
years
at
nyu
and
it
has
proved
very
helpful
you
have
to
find
something
that
works
for
you
here
the
class
is
very
demanding
-----
davachi
is
really
nice
and
clearly
knows
her
information
the
class
is
ridiculously
difficult
because
the
ta's
are
terrible
and
really
hard
graders
tests
were
super
hard
because
they're
only
15
mc
worth
6
points
each
and
an
essay
and
short
answers
which
are
easy
but
she
curves
be
prepared
to
study
your
ass
off
-----
she's
great
really
sweet
and
funny
not
an
easy
class
but
put
in
some
effort
and
you'll
walk
away
from
a
fulfilling
semester
plus
she's
hot
-----
absolutely
hate
her
class
as
a
teacher
she's
not
too
bad
however
her
lecture
notes
are
so
disorganized
what
she
puts
up
on
blackboard
is
hardly
ever
what
is
taught
in
class
it
makes
following
along
really
difficult
and
come
test
day
you
have
no
idea
which
of
your
notes
corresponds
to
which
lecture
notes
-----
this
class
is
what
made
me
want
to
double
major
in
psychology
she
is
a
great
teacher
and
the
research
that
she
has
done
is
really
impressive
she's
really
funny
and
very
clear
during
lectures
which
you
really
have
to
attend
in
order
to
do
well
in
the
class
and
yes
she
is
pretty
hot
-----
she
makes
it
look
easy
the
ta's
are
good
its
fun
material
but
worth
the
effort
-----
hot
funny
really
smart
makes
neuroscience
look
easy
and
popular
-----
tests
were
pretty
difficult
the
averages
were
always
in
the
60's
the
good
thing
is
all
tests
were
curved
only
one
short
paper
davachi
herself
is
kind
of
unapproachable
but
very
smart
a
lot
of
the
test
essays
focused
on
the
articles
we
had
to
read
for
recitation
which
were
long
and
hard
to
read
-----
enthusiastic
teacher
who
gives
tough
but
fair
exams
go
to
class
and
read
and
you'll
be
fine
he
prepares
well
for
class
and
really
cares
about
the
subject
matter
-----
he
was
a
great
professor
exams
were
exactly
like
practice
exams
and
though
his
examples
might
seem
corny
i
feel
like
hes
just
trying
to
engage
the
students
i
would
recommend
him
more
than
skreta
for
sure
-----
very
nice
guy
available
for
questions
or
during
office
hours
he
can
seem
nonchalant
sometimes
especially
with
the
hair
exams
can
get
hard
but
they're
like
the
practice
exams
so
if
you
do
those
you'll
do
very
well
on
the
actual
exams
-----
he's
not
great
at
explaining
things
and
he
flips
his
hair
way
too
much
he
just
reads
off
the
slides
and
adds
things
here
and
there
i'm
not
too
sure
the
other
teachers
are
all
that
good
either
so
-----
i
hate
microeconomics
so
this
class
was
very
difficult
for
me
the
problem
sets
are
just
like
test
questions
and
they
are
very
difficult
i
had
a
hard
time
understanding
him
but
it
might
just
be
that
i
am
not
good
at
economics
he
is
a
nice
person
and
available
for
office
hours
if
you
take
advantage
of
that
-----
there's
just
something
about
this
professor
i
don't
like
so
much
maybe
its
the
hair
his
lectures
are
useless
and
recitations
are
a
complete
waste
of
time
so
don't
bother
going
to
any
the
one
good
thing
is
that
he
prints
out
all
the
lecture
slides
for
you
but
these
are
useless
unless
you
go
to
his
lectures
go
take
skreta
or
the
other
one
-----
his
midterms
and
finals
are
rough
so
study
for
those
but
otherwise
class
isnt
so
bad
and
he
cares
a
lot
about
his
students
-----
sweet
guyvery
awkward
at
times
but
you
learn
to
get
past
it
he
prints
notes
for
you
and
staples
them
before
class--you
don't
need
to
do
much;
just
5
problem
sets
a
couple
of
quizzes
and
the
exams
great
class
sucky
recitationbut
who
cares
-----
not
the
best
professor
ever
but
was
still
able
to
get
the
material
across
knows
plenty
of
real-world
examples
quizzes
are
easy
and
short
you'll
be
well
prepared
for
exams
not
to
much
work
per
night
either
overall
a
nice
class
-----
no
comments
-----
he
is
a
very
nice
professor
and
his
quizzes
are
fairly
easy
as
long
as
you
briefly
review
his
slides
and
pay
attention
to
the
math
problem
examples
before
the
quizzes
you
can
easily
ace
his
class
he
doesn't
give
much
mandatory
hw
his
behavior
can
be
slightly
nonchalant
leading
to
boring
classes
at
times
but
overall
he
earns
my
recommendation
-----
biostats
for
gph
could
be
a
really
engaging
course
but
the
way
roberts
taught
it
made
it
fall
flat
students
could
ask
clarifying
questions
in
class
but
there
was
an
expectation
that
everyone
would
somehow
already
comprehend
every
concept
whether
or
not
they
had
any
quantitative
background
made
for
a
frustrating
semester
for
most
in
the
class
-----
prof
roberts
expects
everybody
to
be
at
his
level
but
he
lacks
the
point
that
we
are
students
there
to
learn
it
if
you
are
so
bothered
with
questions
that
we
ask
you
how
does
learning
happen
then
he
gets
annoyed
with
us
asking
questions
to
get
some
more
clarification
which
he
doesn't
actually
give
any
take
the
course
from
someone
else
if
possib
-----
prof
roberts
seems
to
have
no
respect
for
his
students
even
when
they
try
their
best
to
improve
their
performance
he
consistently
rolls
his
eyes
at
students
when
they
ask
questions
and
goes
out
of
his
way
to
make
them
feel
stupid
he
grades
very
harshly
but
gives
no
productive
feedback
absolutely
would
not
recommend
-----
worst
professor
and
class
is
100%
of
my
stress
not
only
is
he
a
harsh
grader
and
a
bad
professor
he
harasses
his
students
through
not
only
his
constant
eye
rolling
but
through
antagonizing
their
intelligence
on
papers
and
through
what
he
mutters
under
his
breath
whenever
a
student
asks
a
question
unapproachable
save
yourself
please
-----
he
doesn't
care
for
his
students
and
will
not
answer
your
questions
all
of
his
assignments
and
tests
are
arbitrary
and
he
never
gives
clear
directions
for
anything
if
you
get
a
point
off
of
an
assignment
exam
you
have
no
room
to
improve
he
gives
a
lot
of
attitude
to
the
students
and
is
very
degrading
do
not
take
him
as
a
prof
-----
he
doesn't
provide
much
clarifications
for
exams
and
then
is
a
very
tough
grader
he
often
rushes
through
things
and
gets
kinda
frustrated
if
you
don't
understand
or
ask
any
additional
questions
not
the
warmest
guy
doesn't
seem
like
he
wants
to
be
there
definitely
not
the
worst
but
if
have
the
opportunity
to
take
another
prof
consider
it
-----
roberts
provides
you
with
the
minimum
but
in
general
its
very
easy
to
follow
he
likes
things
in
a
very
specific
way
so
as
long
as
your
write
down
exactly
how
it
is
in
class
you'll
be
ok
he
does
take
point
off
for
the
smallest
things
kind
of
annoying
i
found
him
funny
class
is
easy
as
long
as
you
have
a
good
understanding
of
math
-----
roberts
gets
really
irritable
when
you
ask
him
questions
and
isnt
great
at
explaining
things
i
would
take
biostats
with
a
different
professor
if
at
all
possible
also
a
large
portion
of
the
grade
is
group
projects
so
get
ready
to
suffer
-----
it
is
pretty
clear
that
prof
roberts
does
not
care
about
his
students
and
that
he
is
only
at
nyu
to
do
research
he
does
the
bare
minimum
for
students
won't
give
any
extra
help
for
special
circumstances
biostatistics
is
mainly
graded
by
the
group
project
so
if
you're
given
a
bad
group
then
you
will
not
do
well
in
this
class
-----
fun
professor
you
should
take
him
if
math
isn't
your
thing
-----
if
math
isn't
your
thing
you'll
have
to
work
slightly
harder
otherwise
super
easy
as
long
as
you
do
the
minimal
work
-----
chong
is
an
awesome
professor
took
her
visual
culture
class
and
it
was
extremely
interesting
lectures
and
class
discussions
were
very
engaging
and
about
relevant
topics
would
definitely
recommend
her
as
a
professor
and
her
class
-----
song
is
really
an
awesome
prof
take
her
if
you
have
the
chance
i
learned
a
lot
during
the
course
of
her
class
and
she's
really
caring
and
passionate
about
what
she's
teaching
the
material
is
v
accessible
although
there
is
a
fare
amount
of
reading
-----
super
informative
engaging
and
fun
class
to
learn
and
participate
in
there
really
are
no
wrong
answers
and
the
discussions
are
very
comfortable
and
interesting
she's
funny
and
so
passionate
about
her
work
and
it
really
extends
to
the
rest
of
the
class
when
essay
time
comes
around
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
work
but
it's
really
fun
and
personal
-----
song
is
a
wonderful
professor
i
genuinely
enjoyed
coming
to
class
+
doing
the
readings
three
papers
8-12
pages
midterm
one
presentation
came
out
of
class
with
a
better
understanding
of
what
it
means
for
a
photograph
to
not
be
part
of
a
collection
not
like
an
art
history
class
no
memorization
lots
of
room
to
throw
ideas
around
&
explore
-----
song
made
this
course
so
interesting
and
enjoyable
her
essays
require
lots
of
effort
but
i
find
myself
feeling
so
satisfied
doing
the
work
and
applying
all
that
i've
learned
you
will
learn
so
much
from
this
class
granted
that
you
do
the
readings
and
pay
attention
in
lecture
and
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
classes
at
nyu
-----
song
is
so
passionate
about
photography:
gives
great
captivating
relevant
lectures
the
work
is
very
manageable
on
a
weekly
basis
though
she
is
a
tough
grader
in
the
end
she
encourages
you
to
make
great
papers
&
arguments
that
you
are
proud
of
she
too
encourages
you
to
see
exhibits
outside
of
class
very
nice
&
approachablefunny
too
-----
excellent
down
to
earth
knowledgeable
and
in-tune
with
subject
matter
couldn't
ask
for
a
better
professor
-----
chong
is
a
wonderful
professor
she
welcomes
discussion
and
really
relates
to
every
one
of
her
students
even
the
most
nervous
students
want
to
speak
up
class
is
easy
enough:
3
papers
and
a
group
pj
not
necessary
to
read
but
helps
for
papers
appreciates
good
writing
and
opinions

-----
song
is
an
absolutely
amazing
teacher
she
relates
well
to
students
and
is
great
at
facilitating
discussion
which
is
free
flowing
in
her
class
the
class
itself
is
not
extremely
challenging
but
is
enough
to
keep
up
with

her

teacher
communicates
very
well
with
students
integrates
current

what
an
incredible
professor
rita
explained
psycholinguistics
to
the
class
in
one
lecture
and
before
that

wasted
a
whole

trying
to
understand
it
in

said
she's
a
great
teacher

an

lots
of
reading

you'll
learn

of
the
best

class
i
took
@
nyu
i
miss
her
-----
she
does
want
her
students
to
think
yet
she
stifles
what
everyone
has
to
say
with
some
research
that
she
has
conducted
already
sometimes
missing
your
point
completely
she
has
a
huge
ego
i
certainly
wanted
to
learn
and
work
and
didn't
expect
an
easy
a
but
she
was
very
reluctant
to
help
and
listen
she
has
biases
towards
some
students

-----
i
loved
this
professor
the
students
that
complain
about
her
are
most
likely
idiots
just
because
she
wants
her
students
to
think
she
is
hailed
as
this
horrible
professor
i
really
enjoyed
her
class
and
i
learned
a
great
deal
take

class

you
are
not
afraid
of
learning
by
working
and
are

watts
is
a
great
professor
he
has
excessive
knowledge
about

and
always
wants
his
students
to
know
more
than
necessary

he
wont
test
you
on

he
is
a
tricky
guy
when

super
nice
and
really
easy
to

and
understanding
-----
great
teacher
he's
very
clear
about
what
he
expects
from
students
and
very
fair
he
can
be
a
bit
tricky
on
tests
but
if
you
pay
attention
and
read
you'll
do
great
-----
i
love
sheldon
organized
powerpoints
fairly
easy
exams
he's
great
really
understanding
and
helpful
-----
this
guys
know
his
material
is
extremely
down
to
earth
and
is
really
helpful
i
really
enjoyed
learning
about
food
and
our
bodies
-----
his
teaching
style
is
extremely
clear
and
well
organized
the
homework
assignments
are
interesting
and
well-explained
-----
i
am
a
computer
science
major
but
this
class
was
hands
down
my
favorite
of
college
so
far
assignments
are
a
breeze
quizzes
tests
are
not
quite
easy
but
easy
enough
but
mostly
i
just
loved
coming
to
lecture
which
balances
music
and
history
with
good
humor
highly
recommended
-----
this
course
music
and
politics
was
straight-forward
as
long
as
you
read
and
show
up
there
is
alot
of
participation
which
makes
lectures
glide
by
there
was
alot
of
writing
but
i
found
this
better
than
a
final
exam
although
i
did
not
do
great
on
the
final
paper
-----
loved
this
class
fun
enthusiastic
lectures
most
of
the
assignments
were
actually
entertaining
to
do
recommended
-----
if
you
like
to
write
papers
take
this
class
midterm
is
submitting
four
journal
entries
and
final
part
one
is
submitting
the
other
journal
entries
also
have
about
8
response
papers
to
do
throughout
the
semester
final
is
a
ten-page
research
paper
not
an
extremely
hard
class
just
get
ready
to
write
but
there
manageable
-----
this
class
is
really
fun
and
i
will
miss
it
overall
the
class
isn't
difficult
at
all
it
just
involves
a
lot
of
memorization
and
it
is
a
challenge
a
lot
of
the
time
to
distinguish
different
genres
of
music
by
ear
copy
down
everything
written
in
blue
on
the
powerpoint
slides
overall
i
highly
recommend
the
class
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
-----
okay
so
if
you
want
to
take
this
class
for
an
easy
a
just
don't
tooo
much
to
study
dont
expect
this
class
to
be
easy
-----
good
guy
very
tough
final
exam
be
prepared
to
know
specifics
up
the
wazoo
and
i
recommend
going
to
office
hours
even
though
i
didn't
overall
interesting
class
i
won't
say
enjoyable
because
it
really
wasn't
but
worth
the
take
if
you're
willing
to
study
100
flashcards
for
the
final
ps
he
kicked
a
kid
out
of
class
for
being
on
his
phone
-----
the
material
is
super
digestible
the
professor
is
awesome
and
very
knowledgeable
however
rock
history
is
a
bit
of
a
stretch
it
should
be
pop
history
if
you
were
hoping
to
cover
a
specific
band
he
may
skip
over
it
i
waited
the
whole
semester
to
talk
about
rage
against
the
machine
and
0
just
take
the
class
though
don't
be
that
guy
its
fun:
-----
there
are
a
lot
of
required
readings
but
honestly
i
didn't
read
them
all
and
still
did
decently
well
in
the
course
there
is
attendance
and
pop
quizzes
though
so
going
to
class
is
practically
mandatory
but
generally
this
class
was
interesting
and
he
seemed
to
really
enjoy
teaching
the
subject
he's
a
super
sweet
teacher
and
the
class
isn't
hard
-----
by
far
the
best
course
i
have
ever
taken
prof
tausig
is
very
knowledgeable
in
his
field
as
well
as
progressive
and
down
to
earth
definitely
recommend
taking
any
course
with
him
-----
horrible
professor
-
speaks
with
an
accent
that
makes
it
difficult
to
understand
what
he
is
saying
gives
ridiculously
hard
midterms
and
final
2
homework
assignments
due
per
week
-
webassign
and
written
hw
-----
although
he's
a
nice
guy
he's
a
terrible
professor
disregarding
the
accent
he
doesn't
know
how
students'
minds
think
and
consequently
will
make
huge
illogical
leaps
between
steps
during
lecture
leaving
everyone
confused
homeworks
and
quizzes
are
ridiculously
difficult;
although
exams
are
much
easier
-----
always
explain
with
brief
but
clear
proofs
has
his
own
thoughts
other
than
textbooks
-----
a
really
nice
professor
smiles
a
lot
though
the
exercises
and
tests
are
not
super
easy
it's
not
super
hard
you
can
truly
learn
something
in
the
lecture
-----
sooooooooo
nice
-----
fantastic
professor
-----
if
you've
never
taken
calculus
before
avoid
his
class
at
any
cost
because
you
will
fail
without
an
outside
tutor
i
would
often
get
the
right
answer
to
problems
but
not
take
the
same
steps
as
what
he
wanted
me
to
and
he
would
take
a
high
amount
of
points
also
visiting
office
hours
will
get
you
nowhere
he's
just
as
unhelpful
as
his
lectures
-----
wei
literally
reads
from
the
textbook
using
the
same
exact
examples
and
only
looks
at
the
board
english
is
poor
and
tests
are
inconsistent
in
difficulty
i
feel
bad
because
he
is
such
a
nice
guy
but
don't
take
him
-----
pretty
tough
not
because
he
is
a
hard
grader
or
anything
but
because
he's
just
not
that
clear
and
his
tas
are
pretty
abysmal
teaches
lectures
straight
out
of
the
textbook
so
if
you
follow
along
with
him
in
lecture
it
isn't
too
bad
also
means
you
can
skip
class
and
still
self-teach
curves
up
tests
big
time
cus
everyone
does
terribly
-----
worst
class
i
have
ever
taken
unclear
lectures
and
recitation
was
not
helpful
his
english
was
extremely
difficult
to
understand
and
all
he
did
was
repeat
the
textbook
try
and
avoid
him
-----
she's
sensational
-----
absolutely
love
her
she
was
so
helpful
getting
me
caught
up
when
i
was
transferred
into
her
class
from
the
wait
list
she's
also
incredibly
sweet
and
loves
to
joke
around
with
us
and
teach
us
little
korean
culture
tidbits
for
my
future
korean
classes
i
will
be
trying
my
hardest
to
have
her
when
possible
-----
she
is
the
best
professor
i
had
in
college
so
far
she
is
a
great
lecturer
and
truly
cares
for
all
her
students
-----
she's
always
very
helpful
in
making
sure
you
understand
what's
being
taught
she's
very
expressive
funny
and
she
makes
class
fun
-----
amazing
teacher
even
though
my
class
was
mostly
of
native
speakers
she
still
made
each
class
fun
and
exciting
super
helpful
and
encouraging
-----
nicest
teacher
and
extremely
straightforward
grading
is
very
straight
forward
-
i
pretty
much
knew
what
grade
i
was
getting
all
throughout
the
semester
work
load
at
the
adv
level
is
not
too
much
and
you
only
meet
twice
a
week
awesome
professor
i
loved
taking
her
class
-----
really
nice
and
good
teacher
if
you
have
to
choose
between
korean
chinese
and
japanese
choose
korean
because
na
eunju
sunsengnim
is
the
best
she
is
especially
patient
with
non-native
speakers
she
is
very
expressive
and
makes
class
really
fun
-----
best
professor
ever
-----
interested
in
taking
korean
this
professor
will
meet
and
exceed
your
expectations
one
of
the
nicest
professors
i've
ever
had
lots
of
assignments
which
is
normal
for
any
language
class
but
if
you
study
you'll
be
fine
-----
na
seonsaengnim
is
the
best
i
barely
knew
any
korean
before
i
took
elementary
korean
i
but
now
that
the
semester's
almost
done
i
can
actually
hold
a
conversation
in
korean
she's
soooooooo
helpful
patient
and
fun
you
will
not
be
disappointed
with
her
or
her
class
^^
-----
best
stats
professor
ever
way
much
better
than
the
one
in
high
school
he
explains
things
really
clearly
take
his
class
he
is
reallly
nice
-----
professor
chen
is
a
nice
guy
he
cares
a
lot
about
his
students
and
was
cognisant
of
our
workload
and
made
an
effort
to
reduce
stress
about
the
class
that
being
said
i
think
his
stats
class
is
probably
the
hardest
of
the
6-credit
stats
classes
you
can
take
at
stern
it's
not
easy
to
do
well
in
the
class
but
he
makes
stats
bearable
-----
professor
chen
was
one
of
my
favorite
professors
this
semester
since
he
is
so
knowledgeable
and
passionate
about
statistics
his
lectures
are
always
clear
even
if
you
are
confused
he
is
extremely
willing
to
help
students
outside
of
class
definitely
take
his
class

the
best
professors
i
have
had
in
nyu
his
lectures
are
clear
and
concise
with
various
applications
to
the
real
world
thus
keeping
students
from
ever
getting
bored
he
is
really
inspirational
talking
about
statistics
with
great
passion
and
is
willing
to
go
further
than
just
the
lecture
in
office

very
lenient
exams
and
homeworks
follow
exactly
what
you
do
in
class
lots
of
examples
done
in

-----
great
man

easy
homework
and
easy
tests
-----
loves
to
micro
manage
had
no
idea
of
what
she
was
doing
the
entire
semester
-----
she
is
one
of
the
best
professors
in
the
program
-----
ther
workload
is
heavy
and
her
expectations
are
very
high
don't
expect
to
slack
off
in
this
class
and
come
away
with
an
easy
grade
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
ever
had
she
knows
her
stuff
-----
dr
messerli
is
one
of
the
greatest
teachers
i
have
ever
had;
she
is
kind
funny
outgoing
helpful
and
is
incredibly
inteligent
dr
messerli
goes
above

beyond
to

and
every

i
highly
recommend
dr
messerli
for
any
hospitality
class
-----
there
is
alot
of
work
if
you
are
in
scps
and
you
work
a
full
time
job
you
know
the
conswquences
of
a
graduate
class
she
is
a
very
good
professor
and
i
plan
on
takin
other
classes
with
her
-----
i
absolutely
love
her
best
professor
in
the
hotel
school
-----
no
comments
-----
great
professor
lots
of
work
but
learn
alot
of
useful
skills
needed
for
your
career
fair
grader
i
would
continue
taking
class
with
her
if
i
could
she's
a
great
resource
-----
so
much
busy
work
like
an
undergrad
class
don't
take
if
you
have
a
full
schedule
or
you
work
it's
just
too
much
-----
n
a
-----
yeah
who
does
he
think
he
is
some
kind
of
leading
expert
or
someth
um
ok
delete
that
yeah
doesn't
he
know
about
the
tuition
we
pay
if
i
wanted
to
know
when
i'm
wrong
i
could
have
gone
to
community
college
he
should
have
been
more
considerate
of
my
opinions
ps
jost
is
brilliant
-----
he
is
simply
brilliant
his
class
was
interesting
and
his
insightful
comments
always
instigated
great
discussions
his
passion
about
his
area
of
research
and
about
psychology
in
general
is
inspiring
it
was
one
of
the
best
classes
i
have
ever
taken
in
psychology
-----
sometimes
students
will
say
something
in
class
that
he
disagrees
with
or
goes
against
his
own
research
and
you
can
literally
see
him
trembling
with
anger
right
before
he
starts
belittling
their
observation
freaky
weird
-----
patronizing
-----
stay
away--especially
if
it
is
a
small
discussion
group
if
you
have
any
opinions
of
your
own
he
will
squash
them
and
make
you
sorry
you
ever
opened
your
mouth
in
class
couldn't
stand
this
course
worse
class
i
took
at
nyu
-----
he
is
authoritarian--really
needed
to
have
tight
control
of
the
discussion
if
he
could
have
told
each
person
what
comment
to
make
he
would
have
this
makes
for
a
lousy
discussion-based
class--no
free-flowing
thought
kinda
weird
too
twitches
a
lot
when
he
talks
so
i
think
he
is
high-strung
in
general
and
defensive
-----
smug
and
authoritarian
is
definately
not
my
impression
of
him
our
class
was
a
good
mix
of
lecture
and
discussion
and
he
was
adept
at
working
with
student
comments
to
expand
them
into
full
fledged
arguments
he's
earned
his
right
to
be
a
bit
intimidating
but
if
you
work
hard
and
make
an
impression
he
is
extremely
approachable
and
encouraging
-----
major
full-of-himself
pompous
prof
i
hated
this
course
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
in
stern
his
tests
are
super
tough
though
however
i'd
love
to
take
his
class
again
-----
nice
man
horribly
difficult
exams
attendance
only
mandatory
because
he
gives
daily
quizzes
pretty
easy
graded
leniently
by
ta
lots
of
homework
and
reading
the
text
-----
nicest
professor
ever
from
the
first
day
you
can
tell
that
he
really
wants
his
students
to
do
well
and
learn
he
attempts
to
get
to
know
everyone
as
well
there
are
online
assignments
and
quizzes
every
class
-
and
i'm
grateful
for
it
because
of
them
i
have
a
much
better
understanding
of
the
material
than
i
would
have
otherwise
-----
he's
the
nicest
guy
on
the
entire
planet
genuinely
cares
about
his
students
and
their
success
but
don't
let
this
fool
you
his
course
is
hard
and
so
are
his
exams
he
is
very
specific
in
what
he
wants
as
answers
to
his
exams
so
it
is
easy
to
get
questions
wrong
i
recommend
this
teacher
but
don't
underestimate
this
class
-----
nicest
guy
you'll
ever
meet
will
meet
with
you
for
help
whenever
he
is
very
highly
recommended
tests
aren't
too
bad
either
-----
awesome
teacher
has
an
amazing
accent
easiest
of
all
the
financial
accounting
teachers
very
straight
forward
exams
and
bends
over
backward
to
make
sure
everyone
understands
all
of
the
material
highly
recommend
-----
no
comments
-----
by
far
the
best
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
bends
over
backwards
to
help
you
great
new
zealand
accent
-----
he
was
a
great
professor
always
helpful
outside
of
the
classroom
very
nice
guy
wants
students
to
do
well
-----
a
truly
inspirational
professor
mentor
historian
and
individual
my
seminar
joked
that
she
is
a
forrest
gump
type
of
character
in
that
she
was
always
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time:
the
stonewall
riots
the
la
race
riots
she
will
add
a
fascinating
personal
perspective
on
historical
events
and
let
you
see
history
through
a
unique
lense
-----
i
strongly
recommend
taking
professor
baar--one
of
the
best
classes
that
i
have
taken
at
nyu
so
far
-----
i
strongly
recommend
taking
professor
baar
her
class
was
enjoyable
and
insightful
she
really
wants
to
see
her
students
succeed
and
is
more
than
willing
to
help
at
office
hours
one
of
the
best
classes
i
have
taken
so
far
at
nyu
-----
i
had
her
as
my
freshman
seminar
teacher
and
i
couldn't
be
more
happy
i
won
the
jackpot
with
professor
baar-
she
is
the
greatest
freshman
seminar
professor
out
there
i'm
sad
for
all
the
kids
who
won't
get
the
chance
to
be
taught
and
inspired
by
her
she
is
a
wonderful
human
and
absolutely
hilarious
i
will
miss
her
-----
baar
is
not
just
a
teacher
but
an
inspiration
a
role
model
a
friend
baar
goes
above
and
beyond
any
expectations
that
any
student
has
for
a
college
professor
i
truly
enjoyed
taking
her
civil
rights
course
not
only
did
i
learn
a
great
deal
but
i
was
actually
transformed
into
taking
great
interest
in
the
topic
if
you
can
take
her
class
-----
the
best
professor
i
have
had
at
nyu
goes
beyond
genuinely
caring
she
inspires
you
to
think
and
actually
care
about
the
subject
instead
of
just
droning
on
facts
which
is
what
we
should
be
learning
i
love
that
it's
not
about
dates
and
how
its
about
why
and
how
it
can
help
us
in
the
modern
day
grow
you
will
learn
to
be
a
better
human
being
-----
genuinely
cares
about
your
success
in
the
course
goes
to
great
lengths
to
make
you
interested
in
the
class
really
knows
her
stuff
and
tells
many
personal
anecdotes
that
i
really
appreciated
highly
recommend
baar
what
a
gem
-----
super
nice
great
lecturer
the
assignments
are
fun
and
managable
and
she
has
a
ton
of
inside
knowledge
she'll
even
help
you
with
your
research
up
in
the
archives
great
person
to
boot
-
you
gotta
take
this
class
-----
she
is
an
amazing
professor
one
of
a
kind
she
genuinely
cares
about
her
students
and
really
un
derstand
that
they
are
there
to
learn
not
to
fight
for
a
good
grade
very
smart
has
a
lot
of
insight
and
research
knowledge
high
recommended
-----
i
do
not
doubt
her
knowledge
of
mathematics
as
she
does
have
a
phd
i
do
though
doubt
her
ability
to
teach
she
teaches
straight
out
of
the
book
does
not
explain
tough
concepts
clearly
and
does
not
offer
any
methods
to
interpret
them
other
than
what
the
book
offers
should
be
kept
away
from
beginners
to
math
-
more
advanced
students
are
ok
-----
this
was
one
of
the
best
courses
i
have
taken
at
nyu
prof
lushi
taught
us
about
many
math
models
used
in
real
world
applications
i
learned
many
things
including
matlab
programming
and
typing
in
latex
the
final
project
and
presentation
are
useful
things
to
put
in
my
resume
too
i
owe
this
professor
a
big
thanks
for
this
course
-----
okay
teacher
doesn't
put
much
effort
into
teaching
unless
you
really
press
her
for
it
the
lectures
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
book
which
is
a
great
thing
for
me
since
i
hate
reading
the
exam
questions
are
quite
easy
as
they
are
very
similar
to
homework
questions
-----
she
is
a
great
professor
and
caring
of
students
learning
i
struggled
to
understand
the
textbook
by
myself
so
the
lectures
were
super
helpful
luckily
the
prof
made
very
clear
in
the
lectures
about
what
we
absolutely
needed
to
learn
so
that
helped
me
do
well
in
the
exams
and
the
course
-----
she
is
great
at
what
she
does
and
is
very
helpful
if
the
effort
is
put
in
you
will
learn
a
lot
prof
lushi
has
inspired
me
to
further
pursue
math
-----
first
of
all
she's
not
a
good
lecturer
if
you
go
to
class
chances
are
you're
either
going
to
fall
asleep
or
wish
you
could
be
doing
something
else
reads
her
lectures
right
out
of
the
textbooks
which
is
why
almost
half
the
class
never
comes
to
the
lectures
fair
grader
so
if
you
really
do
know
what
you're
doing
you'll
easily
pass
-----
midterm
was
very
tough
but
fair
because
she
had
covered
similar
questions
in
class
homework
can
be
long
-----
she
is
a
good
teacher
explains
things
clearly
is
helpful
in
office
hours
lots
of
homework
but
tests
are
ok
fair
grading
and
nice
policy
of
dropping
lowest
quiz
and
assignment
scores
class
attendance
is
not
mandatory
but
exam
questions
are
easier
if
you
follow
the
examples
from
the
lectures
-----
prof
lushi
is
not
the
best
lecturer
basically
reads
off
txtbook
and
its
examples
but
she
wants
to
help
u
learn
she
tests
you
on
what
she
taught
in
lectures
but
as
long
as
you
can
do
the
hwk
you
will
do
fine
on
your
tests
pretty
easy
tests
but
dont
underestimate
the
class
if
you
dont
go
to
class
and
fall
behind
you
will
definitely
fail
-----
fritz
is
great
he's
very
animated
and
detail
oriented
not
great
at
time
management
and
is
known
to
have
an
angry
burst
from
time
to
time
but
generally
what
he
says
is
gold
he's
got
a
great
eye
for
theater
and
directing
-----
fritz
is
a
cool
guy
and
a
smart
guy
but
i
don't
think
he
is
very
good
at
critiquing
work
in
feedback
that
he
gave
me
he
generally
seemed
to
totally
miss
the
point
of
my
choices
even
though
other
teachers
and
my
peers
completely
understood
because
of
this
he
never
really
said
anything
helpful
to
me
-----
fritz
is
an
absolutely
genius
listen
to
everything
he
says
-----
pretty
regular
a
little
limited
in
feedback
but
always
willing
to
answer
questions
specific
to
your
own
growth
as
an
actor
-----
pentecost
was
an
amazing
experience
thanks
fritz
-----
no
comments
-----
one
of
the
most
useful
classes
i've
taken
thus
far
a
great
teacher
an
honest
teacher
a
teacher
who's
not
afraid
to
tell
you
that
you
screwed
up
and
then
lead
you
to
your
own
conclusions
about
how
to
fix
it
:
-----
fritz
is
incredible
if
you
don't
immediately
love
him
you
really
can't
call
yourself
an
artist
and
should
leave
the
field
immediately
-----
my
most
frustating
class
but
that's
not
the
teacher's
fault
he's
a
good
man
and
a
good
teacher
-----
watching
geluso
speak
is
an
adventure
he
is
super
passionate
well-respected
and
experienced
his
lectures
often
incorporate
stories
of
his
experiences
and
while
his
explanations
are
often
a
little
hard
to
follow
his
lectures
are
super
interesting
and
i
had
him
for
a
class
that
was
easy
enough
that
it
didn't
matter
textbook
wasn't
used
at
all
-----
i've
heard
many
great
things
about
professor
geluso
and
can
see
why
he
is
very
passionate
about
teaching
music
tech
and
has
lots
of
great
things
to
say
however
for
me
he
can
be
hard
to
follow
in
class
as
he
brushes
through
the
slides
and
talks
a
lot
as
someone
who
isn't
an
auditory
learner
i
had
to
do
lots
of
outside
reading
-----
geluso's
not
the
best
at
explaining
concepts
but
try
to
pay
attention
in
class
or
read
the
textbook
because
his
slides
are
pretty
useless
when
it
comes
to
studying
for
the
exams
he's
extremely
knowledgeable
though
and
fun
and
cool
not
condescending
at
all
always
telling
all
sorts
of
interesting
stories
of
when
he
worked
with
famous
artists
-----
mr
geluso
is
a
gifted
instructor
he
really
knows
what
he's
doing
and
he
also
does
not
attempt
to
bs
you
he
obviously
has
a
continual
thirst
for
knowledge
because
he
is
constantly
referring
to
things
he
is
reading
or
has
read
very
brilliant
and
very
easy
to
get
along
with
with
-----
the
class
is
easy
and
if
you
listen
to
him
and
his
stories
about
working
in
the
studios
you'll
find
that
he
knows
so
effin'
much
and
has
been
in
the
game
for
a
while
by
far
one
of
the
most
valuable
teachers
here
-----
didn't
do
much
other
than
listen
to
his
sometimes
questionable
opinion
-----
10
out
of
10
music
tech
students
agree
paul
is
the
best
teacher
to
get
in
the
program
really
knows
his
stuff
extremely
nice
good
sense
of
humor
attendance
policy
is
lax
everything
is
lax
actually
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
lot
of
good
high
quality
material
he
teaches
you
will
learn
a
lot
-----
even
though
he
laughs
at
his
own
jokes
he
is
willing
to
help
and
you
can
skip
his
class
here
and
there
-----
nice
guy
good
teacher
-----
he's
a
nice
guy
and
he
generally
gives
good
grades
still
the
material
is
extremely
boring
some
people
enjoy
it
and
that's
fine
but
a
lot
of
people
were
quite
bored
if
you're
interested
in
philosophy
and
the
theory
behind
performances
then
by
all
means
take
this
class
otherwise
you
won't
really
enjoy
it
and
the
readings
will
be
a
chore
-----
sweetest
guy
knows
what
he's
talking
about
all
you
could
ask
for
in
a
class
on
realism
and
naturalism--
come
on
people
its
not
like
another
teacher
would
make
it
breathtakingly
exciting
this
class
is
worth
taking
you
learn
a
lot
by
reading
and
though
its
never
mandatory
you
often
want
to
great
guy
-----
genuinely
nice
guy
though
class
can
be
quite
boring
still
movie
screening
days
are
optional
and
he
picks
some
unusual
adaptations
-----
genuinely
nice
person
means
well
helps
alot
he
doesnt
like
to
give
bad
grades
really
trying
to
teach
people
i
think
he
is
just
a
sweetheart
-----
he
is
the
sweetest
man
he
wants
you
to
do
well
and
is
very
understanding
a
tad
boring
until
the
class
makes
it
interesting
by
really
getting
into
the
discussions
he
is
very
intelligent
and
gets
excited
when
he
says
something
witty
take
the
class
-----
he
is
a
really
nice
guy
and
has
some
witty
moments
but
for
the
most
part
the
material
is
not
that
interesting
and
if
there
was
more
discussion
the
class
would
be
more
exciting
-----
warning
warning
stay
away
a
total
bloviating
prig
why
is
he
teaching
theater
a
typical
academic
totally
out
of
touch
with
the
typical
nyu
drama
student
-----
no
comments

i
found
it
very
difficult
to
focus
in
this
class
professor
has
a
quiet
manner
and
doesn't
speak
clearly
and
concisely
i
find
it
a
struggle
to
stay
awake
almost
every
lecture
most
of
what
i
learned
in
this
class
i
learned
from
the
readings
that
i
had
to
do
for
papers
not
from
lecture
if
you
like
learning
during
lecture
take
another
course
-----
all
comments
are
completely
true
hard
grader
basically
wants
a
paper
on
his
views
which
can
get
very
frustrating
readings
useless
repeats
himself
many
times
in
unorganized
lectures
yet
gives
helpful
sheets
of
notes
nice
old
man
who
wants
to
help:
will
preread
your
whole
paper
if
you
write
what
he
wants
you'll
get
an

i
had
him
for
ancient
egyptian
religion
and
his
class
was
actually
pretty
good
the
notes
he
makes
them
before
hand
and
can
be
very
helpful
when
writing
the
papers
and
he
provides
all
the
readings
and
bibliography
for
the
papers
which
is
also
helpful
as
it
saves
student
time
finding
texts
by
themselves
he
is
also
an
easy
grader
or
at
least
fair
-----
while
he
he
knows
what
he's
talking
about
he's
a
hard
grader
who
gives
a
boring
lecture
an
hour-long
class
became
torture
so
a
view
of
the
clock
is
a
must
a
nice
man
but
definitely
stuck
in
1950s
academia
i'd
stay
away
if
you
can
-----
makes
a
potentially
interesting
topic
painful
course
is
poorly
designed
class
is
based
on
3
papers
so
reading
is
useless
except
for
those
assignments
if
attendance
weren't
taken
i
wouldn't
bother
going

professor
goelet
is
very
knowledged
and
passionate
on
this
subject
as
well
as
with
his
job
he
is
always
willing
to
help
the
classes
can
be
a
bit
tedious
at
times
my
one
complaint
is
the
large
amount
of
work
for
an
introductory
class
six
papers
in
one
semester
-----
very
difficult
grader
but
always
willing
to
help
out
class
feels
very
tedious
by
the
end
of
the
semester
-----
the
class
is
fantastic
professor
goelet
takes
time
to
give
the
students
all
the
information
necessary
and
beyond
what
is
needed
in
class
he
is
very
interesting
but
don't
take
him
in
the
morning
becasue
it
is
indeed
a
history
class

it's
cool
to
meet
someone
so
incredibly
knowledgable
about
such
a
niche
subject
as
max
msp
as
well
as
just
digital
audio
in
general
dude
is
smart
super
funny
and
a
little
awkward
the
more
you
participate
the
better
because
he
thrives
on
questions
and
gives
great
feedback
not
a
harsh
grader
easy-ish
homework
very
reasonable
guy
-----
very
knowledgeable
in
max
msp
but
sometimes
goes
quickly
through
topics
that
may
end
you
up
in
confusion
that
said
he
is
accessible
for
help
if
need
be
but
you
don't
make
a
project
until
the
last
2
weeks
-----
he's
wicked
smart
at
max
msp
programming
and
could
answer
any
question
you
throw
at
him
but
burns
through
a
lot
of
information
very
rapidly
each
class
to
the
point
you
can't
quite
catch
it
all
the
first
time
does
not
respond
to
emails
very
quickly
expects
students
to
catch
on
quickly

peter

great
professor
he's
extremely
knowledgeable
in

one
of
the
few
and
has
a
sense
of
humor

was
very
surprised
that
he
takes
the
time
to

at
nyu

as
he's
frequently
on
tour
performing
with
broken
bells
not
to
mention
the
shins

wonderful
educator
nyu
needs
more
people
like

be
boring
if

at
all
the

entirely
about

extremely
helpful
if

wonderful
teacher
extremely
knowledgeable
helpful
and
patient
max
can
get
pretty
tedious
-----
extremely
helpful
and
clear
teacher
he
will
challenge
you
but
he
will
help
you
make
the
journey
and
gain
a
lot
of
knowledge
along
the
way
he
is
a
grad
student
and
will
one
day
be
a
phenomenal
full
time
teacher
*do
not
daydream
at
all
in

if
you
miss
a
couple
of
minutes
you

the
best
teachers

fair

nice

don't
take
advantage
of
that-she's
no
fool
and
she'll
see

through

really
cares
about

so
far
-----
what
i
imagined
journalism
professors
would
be
like
before
i
came
to
nyu
so
talented
frank
is
the
kind
of
professor
who
nudges
you
so
gently
in
the
right
direction
that
you're
a
better
writer
before
you
even
realize
he
was
nudging
do
yourself
a
favour
take
his
class
any
class
really
as
long
as
he's

a
great
resource
and
a
fair
grader
he'll
listen
to
you
and
really
try
to
help
you
do
well
totally
recommend
watch
out
though
he
tends
to
get
a
little
lecture-y
in
class
and
repeats
himself
a
lot
-----
i
took
the
beat:
ny
neighborhoods
with
him
last
semester
and
i
loved
it
he's
a
great
professor
and
really
knows
what
he's
doing
since
his
job
at
the
nyt
is
basically
ny
neighborhoods
he's
very
knowledgable
and
gives
great
writing
tips
-----
prof
flaherty
is
a
times
editor
and
one
of
the
best
profs
in
the
journalism
classes
spectrum
at
nyu
take
his
class
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
he'll
make
you
a
much
greater
writer
and
show
you
so
much
support
the
class
is
a
lot
of
work
but
it's
worth
it
he's
a
great
person
and
a
wonderful
teacher
-----
frank
is
such
a
wonderful
teacher
and
mentor
this
is
a
guy
who
will
give
great
advice
when
the
editor
at
your
internship
front-loads
you
who
will
respect
your
writing
interests
and
who
will
be
a
first-rate
reference
for
your
first
job
if
you
can
take
his
class
don't
hesitate
-----
he's
my
hero

does
plus
he's
harvard
educated
and
a
seriously
nice
guy
-----
just
a
few
homework
midterm
and
final
are
easy
but
also
easy
to
lose
points
especially
for
the
short-answer
explanation
problems
for
non-native
english
speakers
prof
wies
speak
very
fast
so
be
focused
if
you
are
taking
his
lectures;
otherwise
self-study
by
the
way
prof
wies
never
uploads
his
lecture
slides
before
class
-----
took
programming
languages
with
him
it's
excellent
his
notes
are
very
clear
and
he
includes
code
examples
you
can
run
yourself
theres'
a
lot
of
homework
and
you
need
to
start
some
pretty
early
to
really
get
them
but
they
teach
you
a
lot
and
prep
you
well
for
exams
he's
also
super
helpful
on
piazza
answers
questions
almost
all
day
-----
i
took
programming
languages
with
him
he
provides
excellent
and
succinct
notes
for
all
the
topics
that
he
teaches
which
makes
understanding
topics
a
breeze
really
loved
the
course
he
solves
doubts
on
piazza
even
at
2
am
in
the
morning
would
definitely
recommend

absolutely
love
to

-----
the
course
materials
were
excellent
and
professor
was
well
prepared
for
the
class
one
of
the
best
professor
i
met
in
courant
strongly
recommend
-----
he
is
very
responsive
on
piazza
and
clears

the
class
notes
are
very
very
good
in
fact
i
he
can
make
some
money
if
he's
willing
to
publish
the
notes
the
lectures
are
not
easy
but
the
homework
and
project
really
help
me
understand
the
materials
-----
would
recommend
principles
of
programming
languages
with
this
professor
-
lectures
and
lecture
notes
were
very
clear
and
well
explained
and
he
was
always
willing
to
help
clarify
textbook
and
attendance
not
really
necessary
as
all
the
info
is
in
the
lecture
notes
pretty
straightforward
class
-----
principles
of
programming
languages
what
not
at
all
what
anyone
expected
most
of
the
class
struggled
but
the
professor
did
not
care
the
class
failed
the
midterm
prompting
a
20
point
curve
but
the
professor
said
we
weren't
trying
hard
enough
there
were
often
mistakes
in
the
hw
code
that
wouldn't
get
noticed
until
the
due
date
wouldn't
recommend
-----
professor
paliwoda
is
certainly
passionate
about
his
studies
and
will
lead
you
into
that
mood

great
but

is
not

an
incredibly
caring
professor
whose
course
was
quirky
and
inspiring
connecting
often
to
the
city
his
homework
is
minimal
but
interesting
and
his
grading
is
clear
and
fair
he
was
also
very
accessible
outside
of
class
and
office
hours
were
always
very
helpful
essays
were
personal
and
the
topics
broad
enough
to
allow
creativity
-----
the
class
is
all
about
war
so
it
can
be
a
bit
depressing
however
i
learned
a
lot
and
was
exposed
to
a
lot
of
new
things
there
are
next
to
no
tests
quizzes
besides
the
final
and
only
two
papers
-----
he
is
an
easy
grader
but
his
lectures
are
boring
and
sometimes
depressing

his
lecture
is
usually
boring
but
he's
chill
about
late
assignments

takes
attendance
sometimes
-----
subject
material
was
really
interesting
but
the
classes
got
a
bit
repetitive

he's
really
nice
and
if
you
hand
in
your
paper
a
bit
late
he's
chill
about
it
lots
of
papers
though
most
of
them
short

he'll
like

prof
paliwoda
was
an
exceptional
writing
i
professor
the
course
theme
of
hope
and
cynicism
was
hugely
interesting
and
offered
flexibility
in
terms
of
paper
topics
there
are
readings
for
each
class
but
they
are
light
and
interesting
i
went
to
office
hours
before
each
paper
was
due
and
always
got
super
helpful
feedback
very
much
recommend
-----
this
guy
knows
everything
about

literally
one
of
the
most
engaging
and
funniest
professors
at
nyu
sure
he
rambles
and
makes
a
lot
of
aeneas
references
but
all
you

to
do
is

and
you're
golden

incomprehensible
lectures
full
of
references
to
authors
not

for
the
course
who
you've
never
read
i
have
no
idea
what
he's
talking
about
even
when
he
says
something
that
might
be
interesting
it's
unclear
what
he
means
and
he
never
explains
it
even
when
you
ask
-----
professor
frecerro
had
interesting
lectures
and
he's
a
pretty
funny
guy

or
break
this

had
the
privalige
of
studying
under

at
nyu
in
florence

the
national
prize
for
italian

up
it's
really
good
class

the
course
in
physio
basis
of

excellent
i

worst
class
i
have
ever
taken
-----
took
physio
basis
of
behavior
with
prof
carr
your
entire
grade
is
based
on
two
tests
and
the
test
material
comes
mostly
from
the
reading
but
the
lectures
are
really
important
in
synthesizing
the
material
he
is
very
knowledgable
but
his
voice
is
very
soothing
start
studying
for
the
exams
on
week
one
it's
a
lot
of
information
-----
took
this
class
for
my
first
semester
of
grad
school
it's
definetely
not
a
hard
class
but
if
you've
learned
alot
of
the
material
in
undergrad
and
think
taking
this
class
should
be
an
easy
refresher
one
word
dont
it's
really
hard
to
stay
focused
his
voice
can
be
very
mellow
and
put
you
to
sleep
take
another
core
class
for
sure
-----
his
class
was
the
best
in
this
program
loved
it

he
is
very
smart
and
clear
even
on
the
complex
topics
i
really
learned
a
lot
from
his
lectures
the
textbook
is
intense
lots
of
material
you
need
to
cover
before
every
session
but
it
really
worth
it
specially
if
you
want
to
learn
about
biological
basis
of
behaviour
-----
extremely
clear
even
on
difficult
and
complex
subjects
dr
carr
is
an
excellent
teacher
-----
he
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
lecturers
of
the
course
he
is
passionate
about
his
work
and
his
topics
may
not
be
the
easiest
but
his
portions
of
the
test
are
very
straightforward
-----
you
will
miss
this
man
when
he
leaves
his
material
wasn't
the
easiest
mainly
because
it
was
cellular
respiration
and
photosynthesis
but
he's
a
great
professor
-----
his
test
was
pretty
hard
i
could
only
get
a
85
on
this
test

pretty
nice
and
a
lot
better
than
the
other
teachers
you
will
have
for
principle
of
biology
-----
he's
a
really
fantastic
professor
a
very
sweet
and
approachable
man
too
he
tends
to
go
pretty
fast
in
his
lectures
but
he
makes
the
topics
engaging
and
understandable
i
wish
he
taught
the
entire
course
of
biology
instead
of
just
a
month
-----
he's
totally
awesome
and
it's
easy
to
follow
his
lectures
i
applied
for
his
plant
evolution
lab
and
i
hate
evolution
and
plants
and
bio
in
general
if
that
tells
you
anything
i
enjoy
bio
much
less
now
that
he's
not
lecturing

very
calm
man
when
you

when
you
realize
how
awful
all
the
other
professors
are

had
him
for
a
freshman
seminar
on
food
species
domestication

-----
dr
hodge
really
cares
about
his
students
and
tries
hard
to
communicate
his
enthusiasm
to
his
class
that
said
he
sometimes
gets
tangled
up
in
his
own
notes
and
wastes
a
lot
of
time
before
realizing
he's
made
a
mistake
class
not
as
rigorous
as
i
expected
for
grad
level
still
one
of
the
best
core
class
profs
in
the
ma
program
-----
had
him
to
math
for
econs

the
math
very
well
and
can
relate

math-inclined

nice
guy
wants
everyone
to
pass
and
realistic
about

sets
from
students
i
think
he
is
very
smart
and
has
a
more
relaxed
approach
to
teaching
which
is
a
nice
change
-----
not
teaching
talk
about
random
stuff
that
is
not
related
to
class
when
students
ask
questions
he
did
not
clarify
what
he
meant
and
then
even
confused
students
he
did
not
prepare
for
the
class
and
give
papers
back
to
students
on
time

think
this
is
the
smartest
man

about
anything
substantial
i
slept
every
lecture
after
the
first
five
weeks
and
got
an
a
but
it
wasn't
fun
he
says
a
lot
of
words
but
doesn't
actually
communicate
any
useful
information
very
pretentious
and
self
absorbed

he
expects
you
to
be
a
recording
device
when
taking
note
if
you
miss

terrible

a
full

more

reads
off
a
script

covers
very
little
material
for
the
number
of
texts

made
required
and
the
amount
of
reading
that
needs
to
be
done
-----
he
is
very
unclear
during
lectures
and
poorly
guides
the
readings
he
tries
to
make
a
connection
between
the
texts
but
it's
a
poor

only
makes
things

prof
marcelle

super
intelligent
and
nice
he
talks
about
lots
of
trendy
events
there're
lots
of
choices
of
topics
for
the
final
paper
and
the
weekly
responses
are
not
graded
based
on
quality--you
just
do
it
but
you'd
better
take
notes
carefully
during
lectures
because
he
puts
some
ideas
altogether
he
is
always
humorous

tbh
he
isn't
that
great
he's
an
easy
a
but
i
didn't
learn
anything
in
that
class
and
i
would
never
take
again
people
will
rate
him
high
bc
it's
super
easy
but
it
was
so
boring
and
not
worth
my
time
at
all
because
he
doesn't
actually
teach

brilliant
teacher
kind
and
flexible
beyond
reason
need
extra
time
no
problem
can't
make
it
to
class
we
all
have
bad
days
reading
is
encouraged
but
not
required
he
engages
mostly
in
relevant
conversation
topics
and
tries
his
best
to
explain
philosophers'
ideas
in
contemporary
terms
don't
be
scared
by
his
orthopedic
shoes
he's
a
darling

this
prof
is
so
great
one
of
the
best
teachers
i
had
at
nyu
i
would
100%
take
his
class
again
definitely
read
in
order
to
get
the
most
out
of
it
you
dont
have
to
if
you
dont
want
to
participate
it
makes
it
so
fun
this
man
is
a
genius
he
really
knows
what
hes
talking
about
and
is
also
extremely
passionate
good
man
who
loves
his
job
-----
great
professor
great
guy
one
of
the
few
i
went
to
consistently
amazes
me
how
he
knows
so
much
about
the
content
lectures
the
exact
length
of
class
without
notes
and
can
still
break
it
down
into
very
easy
to
understand
and
very
clearly
defined
concepts
reading
not
necessary
just
take
good
notes
and
pay
attention
favorite
professor
by
far
-----
he
is
a
real
gem
probably
one
of
the
most
knowledgeable
people
i
have
ever
met
which
he
knows
he
loves
to
drop
off
fun
facts
about
the
world
in
his
lectures
do
not
be
afraid
to
participate
it
makes
the
class
more
fun
and
i
think
he
enjoys
it
more
that
way
he
will
often
crack
at
political
jokes
-----
only
have
some
short
responses
for
completion
marks
the
midterm
graded
tough
and
final
essay
lectures
extremely
boring
and
very
hard
to
understand
the
point
you
only
have
to
do
the
readings
for
the
first
half
of
the
semester
but
there
are
a
lot
super
nice
person
but
not
a
great
teacher
doesn't
always
take
attendance
-----
i
took
this
prof
for
mcb2
his
lectures
were
really
interesting
he
made
such
complex
concepts
digestible
his
slides
can
be
daunting
but
if
you
just
focus
on
what
he
says
during
lecture
recordings
and
you'll
be
fine
he
often
calls
testable
material
'his
favorite'
so
be
on
the
lookout
for
that
-----
prof
christiaen
was
an
amazing
professor
-
the
material
for
his
portion
of
dev
bio
was
really
difficult
but
he
was
really
great
at
breaking
down
concepts
and
making
them
relatively
simple
to
understand
he's
also
very
funny
textbook
wasn't
necessary
but
helped
tests
were
difficult
but
fair
-
pay
attention
in
lecture
and
re-watch
recordings
-----
the
more
classes
i
take
at
nyu
the
more
i
appreciate
him
lectures
are
dense
but
very
clear
and
interesting
he
repeats
important
concepts
so
you
are
clear
on
what
to
study
for
exams
i'm
sad
that
he's
not
teaching
more
classes
:
-----
his
teaching
style
overall
takes
some
getting
used
to
the
lectures
are
very
clear
well-structured
and
informational
also
slips
in
sassy
comments
and
jokes
in
his
monotone
the
tests
were
not
memory-based
but
focus
on
experimental
design
and
logic
i
didn't
like
him
much
during
mcb
ii
but
definitely
enjoyed
devbio
a
lot
-----
explains
concepts
decently
-
most
of
the
time
best
to
go
to
lectures
and
ask
questions
because
he
leaves
gaps
in
knowledge
+
textbook
sucks
+
his
recordings
fail
quite
often
good
thing
is
he's
v
clear
about
what
he
considers
testable
info
so
it's
easy
to
predict
questions
do
any
and
all
practice
exams
you
can
find
he
repeats
questions
-----
squeezes
a
lot
of
detail
into
his
lectures
the
subject
is
a
bit
complex
but
he
does
a
good
job
making
it
easier
to
understand
textbook
use
depends
on
your
learning
style
i
got
by
with
mostly
just
the
lecture
slides
tests
are
tough
so
be
very
thorough
when
studying
-----
very
clear
mostly
focuses
on
broader
concepts
rather
than
specific
details
the
lecture
slides
are
the
most
important
so
don't
really
worry
about
the
book
too
much
-----
your
grade
for
this
class
is
only
based
on
two
things:
your
midterm
and
your
final
there
is
not
a
lot
of
opportunity
to
boost
your
grade
and
even
if
you
do
well
on
the
midterm
getting
an
a
is
still
extremely
difficult
unless
you
are
close
with
the
professor
tests
are
6
essay
questions
and
by
the
end
of
the
exam
i
needed
to
ice
my
hand
-----
you're
going
to
have
to
go
to
lecture
or
at
least
listen
to
the
recording
because
he
packs
those
things
with
information
however
they
are
amazing
you
can
tell
movshon
really
likes
the
material
especially
the
visual
system
he
makes
class
and
material
entertaining
and
is
always
happy
to
answer
questions
it's
an
incredible
class
-----
tony
tries
to
get
through
a
lot
of
material
in
a
single
lecture
but
go
to
his
office
hours
because
he
is
actually
very
helpful
when
he
is
explaining
things
1
on
1
make
sure
that
you
read
the
textbook
because
it
can
be
very
helpful
not
for
every
topic
the
class
is
incredibly
difficult
and
exams
are
graded
harshly
but
30%

-----
tony
is
a
genius
and
a
very
smart
guy
the
only
problem
i
have
with
him
is
that
he
goes
super
fast
and
super
in-depth
with
the
material
the
exams
are
tough
and
he
is
a
tough
grader
it's
hard
to
get
everything
in
class
so
you
must
read
the
textbook
which
is
incredible
and
supplement
with
the
lectures
and
ask
questions
overall
hard
but
cool
prof
-----
phenomenal
professor
very
eloquent
and
well
spoken
commands
the
class
atmosphere
as
any
great
professor
should
teaches
you
more
than
you
need
to
know
but
after
all
that's
what
learning
is
about
don't
come
in
here
expecting
it
to
be
easy
be
prepared
to
work
record
your
lectures
your
recordings
will
be
your
best
friend
come
exam
time
-----
movshon
is
an
awesome
guy
but
not
a
very
good
lecturer
he's
a
genius
but
tends
to
go
too
in
depth
during
lecture
to
the
point
where
it's
hard
to
take
notes
or
keep
up
record
the
lectures
if
you
end
up
taking
this
class
because
you'll
want
to
listen
to
them
again
he
posts
the
lecture
slides
but
the
textbook
is
your
best
friend
-----
one
of
the
most
amazing
people
i
ever
met
this
is
a
weed
out
class
and
it's
not
easy
he
teaches
very
quickly
and
it's
hard
to
keep
up
but
this
man
is
a
genius
he
is
also
incredibly
friendly
and
helpful
he
is
very
eloquent
and
a
beautiful
speaker
grading
is
tough
but
that
does
not
detract
from
my
view
of
movshon
love
this
guy
-----
i
know
professor
peck
is
a
truly
caring
person
and
is
willing
to
assist
you
any
time
you
need
help
however
there
are
only
2
papers
to
be
graded
i
screwed
the
first
one
really
bad
as
a
c+
so
i
had
to
work
extra
hard
on
the
second
paper
readings
are
long
and
heavy
but
interesting
i
nearly
p
f
the
course
but
he
is
really
caring
-----
great
professor
and
great
person
was
happy
to
talk
about
your
thoughts
on
the
paper
beforehand
he
made
himself
accessible
to
help
me
with
my
professor
despite
his
having
issues
with
his
back
very
caring
professor
learned
a
ton
from
him
highly
recommend
taking
his
class
on
vietnam
war
-----
professor
peck
is
more
than
a
great
teacher
he
is
a
really
nice
person
his
classes
are
interesting
if
a
little
info-heavy
at
times
but
he
does
a
fantastic
job
of
explaining
everything
that
you
can't
help
but
be
interested
there
is
a
lot
of
reading
per
class
but
if
you
pay
attention
during
the
lecture
you'll
get
the
main
points
-----
professor
peck
is
my
history
honors
advisor
very
knowledgeable
and
approachable
he's
a
close
friend
to
many
of
the
china
hands
in
the
state
department
and
has
a
ton
of
connections
in
china
as
well
he
teaches
how
to
read
primary
sources
which
is
a
must
if
you
are
gonna
major
in
history
grade
aside
you
simply
won't
regret
taking
his
class
-----
great
professor
and
very
patient
and
helpful
too
outside
class
the
class
is
not
hard
but
there
are
quite
some
readings
assigned
overall
an
easy
a
class
with
interesting
content
-----
easy
class
if
you
come
to
class
and
do
at
least
a
majority
of
the
reading
take-home
exams
a
couple
short
5
page
papers
professor
very
knowledgable
in
his
area
of
asia
in
time
of
50s-80s
very
nice
wants
students
to
engage
with
him
during
lectures
watch
a
lot
of
related
movies
and
documentaries
-----
incredibly
smart
guy
his
lectures
are
very
well-organized
and
informative
he
assigns
a
ton
of
reading
but
i
ended
doing
it
all
because
the
books
were
so
good
hard
class
but
well
worth
it
-----
terrible
all
around
condescending
even
if
you
are
a
hard
worker
does
not
explain
things
clearly
mistakes
in
slides
which
are
extremely
disorganized
when
people
ask
her
questions
she
tries
to
shut
them
up
so
she
does
not
have
to
answer
them
and
makes
you
feel
bad
about
it
on
top
of
it
any
other
professor
but
her
ugh
-----
i
liked
this
professor
in
the
beginning
but
then
i
learned
how
unflexible
she
is
she
always
talks
in
this
soft
voice
so
it
can
seem
like
she
is
being
nice
but
actually
she
is
talking
down
to
you
her
lectures
are
disorganized
and
hard
to
follow
and
boring
the
only
good
thing
is
that
she
wrote
the
book
so
its
like
a
repeat
of
the
lecture
-----
agree
with
everyone
else
she
is
very
spacey
disorganized
unclear
and
it's
a
drag
to
sit
through
her
class
she
can
patronize
and
disrespect
you
all
while
smiling
and
speaking
softy
my
guess
is
she
is
always
trying
to
reduce
her
vocal
effort
but
still
wanting
to
take
jabs
at
you
-----
she
is
one
of
the
worst
teachers
i
have
ever
had
she
is
totally
unorganized
patronizing
and
downright
bizarre
she
is
not
helpful
and
is
mean
spirited
-----
unorganized
unhelpful
unfair
mean
makes
a
lot
of
mistakes
and
will
never
admit
to
them
on
a
test
if
you
wrote
something
from
your
notes
and
she
marks
them
as
wrong
but
you
show
her
it
was
what
she
mentioned
in
class
points
will
not
be
rewarded
total
****
-----
she
really
wants
you
to
learn
the
material
which
is
great
but
she
doesn't
know
how
to
teach
it
she
will
make
errors
all
over
her
notes
and
worksheets
but
will
never
admit
to
them
and
will
expect
you
to
know
what's
write
and
wrong

chris
straayer
is
a
genius
we
love
him
film
theory
is
so
much
less
painful
with
him
teaching
it
-----
chris
is
fantastic
-----
my
favorite
class
since
starting
my
film
ma-
her
focuses
are
more
interdisciplinary
interesting
and
evocative
she
is
easy
going
and
fluid
and
open
to
hearing
other
perspectives
she
allows
students
to
take
ownership
of
their
own
work
and
focus
on
their
interests
really
cool
professor
it
is
a
lot
of
work
but
it's
exciting
and
invigorating
-----
one
of
best
profs
i
ever
had
in
film
school
a
life
changer
-----
i
took
the
almodovar
class
with
her
in
summer
term
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
she
really
makes
sure
you're
doing
the
reading
and
more
or
less
forces
you
to
participate
so
definitely
keep
that
in
mind
but
she
also
emphasizes
that
she
values
that
more
than
the
final
paper
so
trade-off
there
great
class
and
she
is
a
good
professor
--
take
-----
film
theory
is
a
difficult
class
that
is
very
dense
in
its
concepts
and
readings
but
prof
straayer
attempts
to
make
it
understandable
for
us
poor
undergrad
students
and
for
the
most
part
succeeds
lectures
a
bit
long
and
sometimes
dull
grade
based
on
two
papers
which
seems
daunting
but
it's
really
not
that
awful
-----
billy
is
really
friendly
and
easy-going
class
is
pretty
straight-forward
and
it's
very
easy
to
get
a
good
grade
overall
a
good
class
and
you
definitely
learn
a
couple
of
things
you
don't
usually
think
about
overall
i
highly
recommend
him
his
snarky
sense
of
humor
and
sincerity
towards
his
students
make
class
interesting
and
fun
to
attend
-----
he's
super
clever
almost
to
a
fault
but
will
teach
you
how
to
rock
any
interview
a
funny
and
engaging
teacher
who
unlike
many
nyu
professors
acknowledges
that
his
class
is
not
the
be-all-end-all
of
higher
education
but
rather
a
great
opportunity
to
learn
useful
life
skills
definitely
recommended
-----
if
you
take
interviewing
strategies
be
sure
to
get
billy
the
class
was
not
only
fun
but
helpful
he
isn't
out
to
ruin
any
gpas
and
work
load
is
pretty
easy
enjoyed
the
class
a
lot
-----
very
fun
made
our
class
enjoyable
tried
to
be
funny
always
willing
to
answer
my
questions
and
available
for
appointments
-----
he
always
has
helped
me
out
and
i
can
always
get
an
appointment
when
i
need
one
much
cooler
than
the
other
ones
and
he
responds
to
my
email
questions
-----
worst
advisor
ever
won't
make
time
for
you
and
when
he
does
he
does
not
know
the
answer
to
any
of
your
questions
tells
you
to
go
elsewhere
stick
with
one
of
the
other
advisors
who
has
been
there
a
little
longer

needs
to
lose
the
attitude

universally
beloved
and
rightfully
so
if
you
show
up
pay
attention
in
class
and
take
some
light
notes
you'll
learn
a
lot
and
do
very
well
on
tests
if
you
don't
really
pay
attention
you
can
honestly
still
pass
daryl
can
make
the
most
mundane
topics
seem
interesting
and
worthwhile
and
he
has
a
great
sense
of
humor
ily
daryl
-----
he
is
funny
with
puns
this
course
is
interesting
but
also
very
confusing
bc
there
is
a
lot
of
math
which
i
am
terrible
at
even
with
calculator
and
all
these
material
are
new
to
my
life
which
i
am
afraid
i
can't
pass
this
class
including
the
tests
or
presentations
i
might
get
an
d
or
f
even
if
i
am
trying
hard
wish
me
best
luck
readers
thanks
-----
he
is
a
great
teacher
there
is
a
lot
to
look
forward
to
when
you
have
daryl
on
your
schedule
-----
daryl
is
the
best
very
funny
and
smart
so
approachable
made
a
fairly
boring
subject
and
a
required
class
for
me
so
enjoyable
definitely
take
his
class
if
you
are
interested
in
anything
stagecraft
-----
the
most
approachable
professor
in
the
world
a
wonderfully
friendly
guy
who
cares
about
theater
immensely
-----
amazing
professor
very
understanding
and
cares
a
lot
about
his
students
explains
things
in
a
way
that
is
both
crystal
clear
and
humorous
discussions
of
nails
and
hammers
have
never
been
so
riveting
crew
hours
are
only
tough
requirement
but
worth
it
for
the
full
stagecraft
experience
awesome
class
-----
i
took
mod
american
drama
and
history
of
drama
1
with
roger
oliver
attendance
is
not
mandatory
but
i
always
felt
guilty
missing
a
lecture
he's
great-
he
loves
the
subjects
and
he
likes
teaching
not
a
very
interactive
class
but
he
knows
so
much
pretty
easy
grader
too
definitely
recommend
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
had
at
nyu
his
lectures
are
always
interesting
sometimes
more
than
the
plays
themselves
so
even
though
attendance
isn't
mandatory
i
highly
recommend
going
midterm
final
paper
cute
little
man
too
-----
i
absolutely
love
professor
oliver
attendance
is
not
mandatory
but
i
rarely
missed
his
9:30am
class
he
does
not
pressure
anyone
to
talk
there
are
no
frivolous
quizes
and
he
does
not
trick
his
students
he
went
to
stanford
and
knows
everything
about
theatre
he
is
so
passionate
and
while
if
you
sit
and
listen
you
will
learn
so
much
-----
while
it
is
easy
to
get
a
good
grade
you
cannot
help
but
learning
in
his
classes
to
the
reviewer
who
claimed
he
wandered
in
his
lectures
this
may
be
true
but
it
was
always
to
the
point
which
is
getting
the
most
out
of
these
texts
he's
great
take
his
classes
-----
nice
professor
straight
forward
assignments
interesting
texts-easy
in
that
it
isnt
difficult
to
get
a
good
grade
but
i
still
feel
like
i
learn
from
him
-----
prof
oliver
means
wellbut
he
can't
help
that
his
class
is
somewhat
boring
he
never
stays
on
track
with
what
you
are
talking
about
which
is
why
attendance
isn't
mandatory
overall
the
texts
are
interesting
because
they
are
historical
dramas
but
the
class
is
not
interesting
at
all
-----
took
her
for
calc
3
this
semester
and
it
was
a
nightmare
i
came
to
this
class
loving
math
and
doing
well
with
adequate
studying
the
amount
of
effort
i
put
into
this
class
and
am
hoping
to
get
a
c
she
runs
through
the
material
and
does
not
explain
it
well
do
not
take
this
class
-----
had
her
for
calc
iii
which
is
a
tough
subject
to
begin
with
i
felt
she
explained
everything
pretty
well
but
definitely
take
advantage
of
office
hours
for
clarification--she
goes
over
things
really
quickly
in
class
challenging
class
but
she
tries
to
make
it
as
manageable
as
possible
recommend
-----
took
quantitative
reasoning:
math
patterns
in
nature
with
her
the
class
was
really
easy
but
frustrating
because
the
class
moved
so
slowly
full
of
useless
information
too
definitely
what
you
want
to
take
if
you're
not
a
math
person
and
don't
care
about
learning
math
-----
way
too
much
work
and
not
enough
explaining
but
if
you
get
it
all
done
-
work
with
other
ppl
youll
be
fine
meet
with
her
and
she'll
explain
a
lot
better
-----
very
nice
and
approachable
but
not
very
good
at
explaining
she's
a
bit
too
tough
on
grading
considering
what
we
learn
in
lecture
is
basic
compared
to
the
application
problems
on
the
exams
-----
this
was
her
first
semester
to
teach
she
is
very
nice
but
an
extremely
tough
grader
and
creates
hw
problems
far
beyond
what
is
taught
in
class
i
get
it
that
she
is
trying
to
push
the
students
but
no
time
is
spent
reviewing
the
work
to
ensure
we
understand
and
have
the
math
accurate
-----
zeb
is
an
amazing
professor
he
makes
the
subject
really
enjoyable
and
fun
i
wouldn't
say
its
an
easy
a
but
it's
definitely
a
class
where
if
you
put
in
the
time
and
do
the
readings
you
will
get
an
a
people
told
me
it
was
an
easy
a
but
that's
misleading
-
he
really
requires
you
to
keep
up
with
the
readings
and
to
produce
good
essays
-----
he
makes
an
uninteresting
subject
at
least
for
me
very
interesting
by
teaching
us
the
subject
in
a
clear
concise
and
relatable
manner
yeah
history
can
be
boring
but
zeb
really
knows
how
to
make
you
understand
the
ideals
and
events
giving
me
hm
i
never
knew
that
moments
there's
alot
of
reading
but
he
kinda
lets
us
knows
which
ones
matter
-----
very
manageable
class
as
long
as
you
read
the
assigned
docs
books
there
is
a
lot
of
reading
but
zeb
really
hints
which
ones
are
important
your
grade
consists
of
4
essays
1
midterm
and
1
final
-
all
of
which
are
not
that
bad
i
think
i
only
read
20-30%
of
the
material
but
still
got
an
a
for
the
course
really
informative
class
and
i
enjoyed
it
-----
so
passionate
about
the
class
and
very
chill
about
everything
:
-----
the
profesor
is
young
and
makes
the
class
extremely
interesting
if
you
know
a
little
bit
of
spanish
and
follow
the
readings
its
an
easy
and
enjoyable
a
-----
the
instructor
is
clearly
very
interested
and
passionate
about
the
subject

he
is
informed
about
the
course
material
and
makes
the
effort
outside
of
class
time
to
find
out
anything
the
students
might
wonder
very
enthusiastic
and
engaging

the
class
interesting

95%

is
really
easy
to

hard
to
get

drew

an
incredible
guy
he's
extremely
well-informed
about
the
topics
because
he
is
truly
passionate
about
the

he's
chill

still
finds
great
ways

professor
thomases
is
great
at
selecting
relevant
material
and
guiding
class
discussions
around
the
assigned
readings
he
helped
create
an
atmosphere
of
safe-sharing
for
all
and
welcomed
everyone's
thoughts
as
he
encouraged
us
to
dig
deeper
really
though
the
guy
is
super
cool
and
you
should
take
his
class
-----
professor
thomases
maintained
an
atmosphere
of
tolerance
and
sensitivity
in
our
discussion
based
class
where
many
student
had
varying
opinions
on
ongoing
religious
political
conflicts
in
south
asia
the
readings
were
chosen
carefully
from
a
variety
of
academic
disciplines
and
professor
thomases
was
always
approachable
friendly
and
helpful
-----
professor
thomases
is
a
phenomenal
instructor
and
encourages
student
participation
the

focusses

and
analyses
of

thomases
always
brings
up
relevant
and
interesting
examples
from
his
own
research
work
he
offers
great
feedback
on
paper
proposals

-----
drew
is
a
fantastic
professor
there's
a
fair
amount
of
reading
in
this
course
not
too
much
but
you'll
want
to
keep
up
he
gives
very
easy
pop
quizzes
so
if
you
show
up
to
class
you'll
get
an
a
-----
had
him
for
texts
and
ideas
which
is
a
class
everyone
hates
lecture
is
not
mandatory
but
i
actually
loved
attending
them
the
concepts
he
talks
ab
are
extremely
interesting
and
thought
provoking
the
readings
are
long
and
complicated
but
i
would
definitely
take
a
class
w
him
again
he's
a
very
interesting
man
with
a
lot
to
say
-----
his
lectures
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
readings
and
he
just
rambles
on
and
on
repeating
the
same
ideas
what
a
waste
of
time
attending
class
the
most
useless
class
ive
taken
thus
far
-----
his
lectures
are
not
the
most
exciting
things
in
the
world
but
if
you
actually
pay
attention
and
listen
to
what
he
is
saying
he
talks
about
some
really
interesting
concepts
it
can
be
tempting
to
skip
lectures
because
there
really
is
no
penalty
but
it
pays
off
in
the
end
to
attend
plus
it's
just
polite
-----
iampolski
is
amazing
:
his
class
is
basically
his
philosophy
on
life
and
all
other
things
interesting
and
it
often
seems
rambly
and
unstructured
but
in
the
best
way
possible
-----
professor
iampolski
rocks
my
socks
he
may
be
a
little
hard
to
understand
at
times
but
he
is
the
nicest
man
in
the
world
and
unless
you
are
a
complete
retard
will
give
you
a
decent
grade
-----
iampolski
is
the
most
russian
man
in
the
world
in
all
the
right
ways
he's
a
little
hard
to
understand
with
his
accent
but
he's
so
knowledgable
about
the
subject
that
you
fight
through
it
if
the
topic
doesn't
interest
you
though
don't
expect
him
to
reel
you
in
but
definitly
one
of
the
best
classes
i've
taken
hes
a
lot
of
fun
-----
professor
thomas
is
an
inspirational
person
he
tries
his
best
to
explain
every
writing
assignment
and
makes
sure
everyone
get
it
he
is
accessible
outside
of
the
class
just
email
or
talk
to
him
after
class
-
he
is
a
very
nice
guy
he
might
be
a
tough
grader
but
if
you
work
hard
and
understand
the
reading
materials
you
will
be
successful
-----
he
doesnt
clearly
explain
his
standards
for
the
papers
he
assigns
and
hes
a
heavy
grader
-----
you
may
have
been
good
at
writing
before
but
if
you
aren't
flexible
enough
to
change
your
writing
style
to
his
then
you
won't
get
good
grades
his
teaching
style
is
not
the
greatest
either
since
he
might
appear
to
be
patient
at
first
but
then
become
frustrated
if
you
question
him
for
commenting
something
on
your
essay
-----
professor
thomas
is
one
of
the
best
professors
ive
ever
had
at
nyu
hes
more
concerned
with
making
sure
that
students
produce
their
best
work
than
he
is
with
reaching
a
certain
deadline
he
gives
great
feedback
hes
funny
and
he
makes
class
interesting
to
the
point
where
you
forget
that
youre
in
class
you
will
have
to
work
for
your
grade
-----
i
don't
really
prefer
this
professor
because
he
has
a
very
selective
taste
you
literally
have
to
change
your
whole
writing
style
to
his
standards
to
even
get
an
a
i
feel
as
if
he
can
be
an
amazing
professor
if
he
really
opened
his
mind
but
unfortunately
this
is
not
the
case
if
you
get
this
professor
prepare
yourself
-----
amazing
writing
i
professor
he
is
always
motivated
to
teach
and
the
classes
are
interesting
i
recommend
this
professor
without
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
-----
one
of
my
fave
professors
at
nyu
he
really
makes
the
objectives
within
the
case
studies
clear
and
breaks
it
down
into
simpler
terms
for
better
comprehension
paul
also
answers
any
of
your
questions
he's
very
in
touch
with
the
current
media
market
and
is
overall
engaging
please
take
a
class
of
his
if
you
can
he
is
such
a
nice
man
-----
hardart
is
very
nice
and
open
he
encourages
participation
and
genuinely
cares
about
what
each
student
has
to
contribute
for
a
course
required
by
the
bemt
minor
he
is
the
best
way
to
get
it
done
however
the
course
gets
very
repetitive
and
never
provides
anything
to
novel
or
interesting
i
wouldn't
way
i
learned
anything
new
-----
extremely
knowledgeable
in
the
fields
of
entertainment
and
marketing
incorporates
his
real
life
experience
into

discussions
wants
to
hear
from
students-
randomly
calls
on
you
but
never
embarasses
you
grade
consists
of
case
studies
and
a
big
group
project
fair
grader
clear
expectations

best
professor
ever
-----
professor
hardart
is
an
overall
great
teacher
he
is
knowledgeable
about
the
entertainment
industry
and
is
passionate
about
the
subject
i
would
have
liked
to
dive
deeper
into
specific
entertainment
subjects
but
that
being
said
if
you
put
the
effort
into
this
class
you
should
do
fine
-----
whoever
wrote
the
first
review
was
lying
professor
hardart
grades
harshly
and
won't
re-adjust
lectures
are
long
case
studies
are
fun
but
graded
harshly
unresponsive
to
emails
and
apathetic
to
student
input
it's
a
2
credit
course
it
shouldn't
be
taken
so
seriously
or
graded
like
a
5
credit
course
take
another
professor
if
you
can
-----
if
you
have
the
chance
to
take
paul
do
it
he
is
a
wonderful
professor
who
is
devoted
to
fostering
a
passion
for
marketing
within
his
students
he
offers
career
help
outside
of
class
talks
down
the
jargon
to
a
very
relatable
level
and
uses
real
world
examples
to
illustrate
points
really
great
professor
-----
hilarious
professor
he
was
put
in
a
tough
situation
of
teaching
classical
and
quantum
waves
in
place
of
physics
iii
when
none
of
has
had
the
math
background
he
did
the
best
he
could
with
what
he
was
given
and
i
feel
i
walked
away
knowing
waves
really
well
-----
he
uses
his
lectures
as
30%
stand-up
routine
20%
side-tracked
rambles
and
50%
actually
teaching
though
the
teaching
portion
is
highly
disorganized
and
he
spends
most
of
his
energy
deriving
things
on
the
board
for
himself
that
he
really
should
have
written
down
in
advance
you
basically
have
to
teach
yourself
from
the
textbook
to
know
anything
-----
this
class
is
fine
if
you
have
an
essay
ta
has
the
lab
reports
are
the
most
important
however
he
doesn't
teach
very
well
so
lecture
isn't
helpful
the
lab
reports
and
coding
assignments
were
extremely
demanding
even
though
they
should
be
easy
assignments
drops
two
lowest
grades
so
i
didnt
have
to
take
the
final
was
rude
to
me
at
office
hours
-----
has
no
chill

awesome
dude
there
to
help
very
entertaining
lectures
-----
really
good
professor
if
you
do
your
work
and
go
to
class
you
should
be
fine
-----
she
is
an
amazing
teacher
and
truly
cares
about
her
students
hence
her
profession
make
sure
to
read
the
instructions
very
clearly
because
she
will
deduct
points
if
you
miss
small
things
but
overall
fair
grader
and
when
available
use
examples
from
outside
world
ie
interview
a
teacher
etc
she
values
student
discussion

intense

would
have
gotten
the
same
out
of
the
class
with
50%
less
work
she
is
pleasant
though
and
smiles
a
lot
very
available
-----
she
does
alot
of
teaching
from
the
book
but
that
is
much
due
to
the
class
i
presume
anyhow
she
is
very
very
nice
and
very
avalible
to
talk
she
grades
fairly
and
gives
alot
of
work
but
it
is
fair
and
spreads
out
the
grades
nice
prof

of
thinking
beyond
her
own
generally
a
disappointment
for
a
class
that
should
be
a
highlight
-----
i
took
her
class
at
a
different
school
she's
a
nightmare
unprofessional
emotionally
unstable
unrealistic
she
simply
is
not
fit
to
teach
and
i
got
a
good
grade
-----
horrible
unproffesional
professor
should
be
fired
-----
she
is:
extremely
disorganized
very
controlling
unclear
does
not
help
you
at
all
never
take
this
prof
for
any
class
including
documentary
-----
no
comments
-----
he
also
teaches
earth
science
at
the
fashion
institute
which
is
where
i
took
him
he
rants
and
was
one
of
the
worst
most
boring
professors
i
have
ever
had
he
can
be
rude
and
condescending
at
times
he's
also
clearly
biased
and
helps
some
students
more
than
others
irritating
but
you
can
make
an
a
in
his
class
it
wasn't
terribly
difficult
-----
awful
rants
and
doesn't
make
sense
complains
about
nyu
and
what
he
is
paid
and
really
pushes
his
political
ideology
one
more
anti
bank
rant
and
i
am
going
to
cry
it
is
an
ecology
course
-----
makes
simple
subjects
totally
incomprehensible
by
using
metaphors
which
don't
make
sense
does
angry
rants
and
comedy
for
half
of
class
on
subjects
entirely
unrelated
which
he
has
little
expertise
gives
the
same
spiels
every
course
bottom
line
is
i
signed
up
because
i
love
the
subjects
and
havent
learned
anything
-----
history
of
the
universe
professor
these
previous
three
reviews
are
obvious
flame
anyways
he's
a
nice
guy
who
tries
to
make
incredibly
dull
subject
matter
interesting
lots
of
videos
which
helps
quizzes
practically
every
week
but
easily
studied
for
definitely
recommend
him
-----
no
comments
-----
lectures
are
well-organized
he
use
his
own
lecture
notes
hws
are
fine
he
gave
a
sample
midterm
but
the
actual
midterm
is
really
hard
and
almost
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sample
really
hard
to
reach
outside
the
class
probably
because
he's
a
part-time
professor
-----
the
lectures
are
structured
but
the
midterm
exam
is
really
hard
since
he
wanted
everyone
unfinished
he
is
so
busy
and
no
office
hours
offered
almost
never
responds
emails

stochastic
calculus
-
provides
concrete
motivation
in
applicable
scenarios
explains
things
at
a
level
accessible
to
everyone

can
answer
the
more
technical
questions
when
asked
notes
are
very
organized
and

the
topics
in
well
order
very

keeps
the

interested
even
for
long
lectures

i
took
his
stochastic
calculus
class
he's
very
organized

to

freshman
honors
seminar
very
easy
and
lenient
grader
extremely
clear
and
helpful
on
the
verge
of
genius
and
i
love
his
dry
humor
he
admits
that
he
is
sort
of
a
nerd
but
he's
the
awesome
type
rather
than
the
annoying
and
hey
all
of
us
in
that
class
were
pretty
nerdy
-----
prof
is
trying
to
make
class
a
little
easier
on
you
makes
awkward
jokes
for
example
but
overall
he
explains
the
material
clearly

very
well

sure
to
add
numerous
examples

i've
taken
multiple
courses
with
robson
she
is
amazing
if
you
are
interested
in
victorian
literature
helpful
fair
if
you
do
your
work
and
leads
some
great
discussions
papers
are
graded
fairly
and
are
open
if
you
do
some
careful
planning
and
reading
her
courses
are
rewarding
and
fun

do
not

best
english
prof
i've
had
sweet
and
engaging
made
me
see
things
in
a
whole
different
way
-----
she
assigns
so
much
reading
but
she's
a
good
lecturer
also
i
think
the
tas
do
all
the
grading
but
take
her
class
if
you
want
to
be
actually
interested
she
makes
it
all
really
cool
-----
i
love
this
professor
i
pretty
much
spent
the
semester
gazing
adoringly
at
her
-----
robson
might
be
the
most
adorable
prof
i've
ever
had
she's
brilliant
engaging
and
so
british
i
don't
always
agree
with
everything
she
says
and
while
she
encourages
discussion
she
doesn't
necessarily
like
to
debate
with
students
but
her
classes
are
always
fun
and
thought-provoking
i
highly
recommend
her

i
took
chem
102
over
summer
and
it
was
his
first
time
teaching
it
and
his
tests
were
brutal
i
did
all
the
homework
assigned
attended
all
lectures
and
studied
like
crazy
but
his
poorly
written
tests
were
really
difficult
his
exams
might
be
different
now
it
might
have
just
been
a
hiccup
since
it
was
a
summer
course
goodluck
-----
great
teacher
i
took
chemistry
at
msjc
in
the
summer
and
it
was
his
first
time
teaching
here
i
enjoyed
his
class
he's
very
helpful
and
knowledgeable
he's
there
to
see
you
succeed
however
if
you
don't
do
the
work
well
that's
your
fault
if
you
do
the
homework
read
study
the
notes
you
take
in
class
you'll
do
great
-----
attended
chem
102
at
msjc
he
writes
his
own
tests
which
are
riddle
with
potentially
grade
destroying
errors
he
is
young
ambitious
and
very
hard
working
but
doesn't
check
his
tests
adequately
before
handing
them
out
which
could
prove
disastrous
for
the
unwitting
student
worst
grade
in
my
academic
career
in
part
due
to
error
laden
exams
-----
chemistry
is
a
challenging
subject
to
begin
with
but
josh
made
it
understandable
and
clear
as
long
as
students
do
their
homework
tests
become
less
challenging
because
homework
is
for
practice
even
though
josh
is
fairly
new
at
teaching
he
knows
his
stuff
i
would
definitely
take
another
class
he
teaches
-----
he
is
a
good
instructor
and
new
at
msjc
he
explains
everything
well
i
took
his
class
on
summer
semester
he
gives
a
quiz
each
class
meeting
and
there's
extra
credit
questions
on
exams
usually
15
points
i
hate
chemistry
but
that
changed
when
i
took
his
class
he
is
very
helpful
and
i
totally
recommend
his
class
to
everyone
interested
-----
class
was
great
teacher
is
the
best
must
read
and
keep
up
with
current
social
issues
and
articles
be
ready
to
talk
about
the
issues
at
the
beginning
of
class
stick
to
the
facts
best
class
ever
-----
professor
brooks
is
a
thoughtful
person
he
cares
about
people
and
he
helps
you
look
at
polices
and
institution
differently
he
sparks
conversations
and
expect
people
to
share
their
thoughts
he
is
fair
and
allows
room
to
be
creative
if
he
teaches
policy
ii
i
will
definitely
take
his
class
again
-----
he
explains
everything
really

prof
brooks
again
he's
such
an
amazing
teacher
he
really
cares
about
the
students
he's
very
understanding
prof
brooks
inspired
me
to
learn
more
about
policies
and
seriously
who
wants
to
learn
about
the
admin
side
of
social
work
right
if
you
want
a
unique
college
experience
take
him
2
papers
that
you
can
def
a's
-----
prof
brooks's
lectures
are
dense
in
intellectual
conversations
about
the
world
participation
is
very
important
he
loves
to
see
his
students
speak
and
discuss
important
topics
he's
very
big
on
staying
in
touch
with
the
world
and
current
events
going
on
in
the
world
he
genuinely
shows
he
cares
about
his
students
-----
two
thumbs
up
-
you'll
learn
a
lot
from
this
course
there
are
interesting
materials
outside
the
textbook
but
are
not
required
she
is
very
approachable
and
wants
you
to
do
well
highly
recommended
-----
cool
class
-
very
hands
on
at
the
end
for
group
project
and
real
world
knowledge
-----
great
teacher
one
of
the
best
classes
i've
taken
-
she
is
very
knowledgeable
in
both
finance
and
economics
reading
are
required
but
helpful
and
can
relate
to
my
work
especially
the
case
studies;
will
take
her
again
-----
a
really
nice
professor
who
is
very
willing
to
reach
out
for
you
except
for
the
materials
about
the
class
she
would
also
provide
you
a
lot
of
advice
for
industry
she
has
a
very
solid
background
in
banking
really
love
her
-----
good
professor
but
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
read
the
textbook
-----
good
professor
and
most
of
the
homework
and
things
to
do
is
not
too
difficult
very
responsive
on
piazza
only
knock
is
that
midterm
you
get
1
cheat
sheet
but
on
final
you
get
1
despite
it
covering
both
midterm
material
and
material
after
the
midterm
-----
computer
networks
was
a
cool
and
informative
course
to
take
with
anirudh
as
professor
he
was
super
responsive
out
of
class
and
also
responds
well
to
students'
feedback
for
the
course
overall
homeworks
and
exams
are
very
reasonable
with
the
last
hw
being
open-ended
one
of
the
better
cs
electives
to
take
imo
-----
he
is
unclear
about
some
concepts
and
will
just
point
you
to
links
rather
than
explaining
makes
me
wonder
if
he
knows
the
concept
well
himself
it
is
hard
to
understand
him
sometimes
-----
this
was
a
really
fun
class
anirudh
was
great
with
the
lectures
and
very
accessible
outside
class
-----
although
it
was
his
first
time
ever
teaching
anirudh
proved
himself
to
be
one
of
the
best
lecturers
at
nyu
within
a
week
he
had
learned
all
his
students
names
and
prompts
students
to
actively
participate
he
writes
his
lectures
by
hand
but
provides
a
neatly
formatted
pdf
afterward
online
very
knowledgeable
about
networks
would
highly
recommend
-----
one
of
my
favourite
profs
at
nyu
so
far
she
cares
about
her
students
and
always
looks
for
ways
to
improve
her
teaching
she's
funny
and
keeps
class
entertaining
and
informative
also
helps
you
with
your
professional
development
skills
-----
go
to
class
everyday
and
participate
she's
a
great
teacher
-
funny
nice
and
very
knowledgable
i
really
enjoyed
having
her
for
health
&
society
in
a
global
context
very
established
professor
and
extremely
personable
makes
it
seem
like
it's
a
5
person
class
when
really
there's
30
people
in
the
class
-----
marie
is
an
amazing
professor
at
first
i
was
irritated
by
her
constant
ums
but
they
grow
on
you
and
she
is
hilarious
she
even
had
us
write
what
we
did
didn't
like
the
um
was
one
of
them
and
she
joked
about
it
she
genuinely
cares
about
her
students
and
made
sure
we
were
prepared
for
our
careers
not
just
her
class
easy
grading
-----
one

had
at
nyu
cares
so
much
about
her
students
and
is
incredibly
receptive
of
feedback
cares
a
lot
about
practicality
and
had
multiple
classes
devoted
to
professional
development
i
had
to
take
this
course
for
my
major
and
i
was
dreading
it
but
i
ended
up
really
looking
forward
to
each
class
also
she's
hilarious
-----
disorganized
but
understands
what
she
teaches
any
feedback
regarding
her
teaching
matters
to
her
and
will
do
whatever
to
improve
your
experience
in
her
class
despite
her
flaws
she
definitely
puts
in
effort
to
make
the
class
engaging
-----
i've
had
professor
k
for
two
classes
and
he's
by
far
my
favorite;
he's
engaging
inspirational
and
straightforward
about
what
he
wants
it's
really
important
to
remember
that
your
first
impression
is
everything
to
him
his
exams
are
easy
as
long
as
you
study;
he
literally
gives
you
the
questions
take
him
and
you
won't
regret
it
-----
professor
k
is
easily
the
best
professor
our
class
has
had
he
is
a
highly
driven
optimistic
and
ever
encouraging
when
you
walk
out
of
his
class
you
can
be
certain
about
walking
away
with
deeper
knowledge
of
the
industry
and
the
subject
he
doesn't
use
jargons
while
teaching
and
uses
a
lot
of
examples
he
is
an
amazing
mentor
-----
very
encouraging
person
a
true
mentor
and
a
leader
he
was
flexible
and
went
out
of
his
way
to
give
me
another
chance
when
i
couldn't
make
it
for
a
class
quiz
apart
from
the
syllabus
and
text
books
he
brings
personal
life
lessons
to
class
which
is
his
best
characteristic
enjoyed
his
lectures
and
love
him
as
a
professor
and
a
human
being
-----
great
professor
will
not
only
teach
you
the
professional
knowledge
but
also
will
have
long
term
positive
impact
on
your
life
professor
karaburun

the
opportunity
to

from
the
best
in
the
industry
his
classes
are
fun
energetic
and
beyond
expectations
-----
professor
k
is
the
best
professor
one
could
ever
ask
for
he
is
passionate
knowledgeable
and
full
of
energy
learned
so
much
from
him
whether
it
be
a
sit-in
lecturea
guest
speaker

brought
in
or
a
day
of
field
trip
hes
innovative
tech
savvy
and
an
exceptional
communicator
participate
and
pay
attention

notes
then
you
will
do
fine:
-----
joost
brings
alot
of
fun
and
inspirational
guest
speakers
from
all
over
the
games
industry
like
microsoft
and
his
lectures
showcase
that
he's
super
knowledgable
about
video
game
history
business
etc
his
class
is
only
two
assignments
and
he
likes
student
engagement
he's
nice
and
answered
emails
promptly
our
ta
made
the
class
not
as
fun
tho
-----
this
guy
is
horrible
very
monotone
and
boring
lecturer
gives
one
midterm
and
one
final
and
barely
gives
any
guidance
on
how
to
do
them
the
tf
is
100
times
worse
and
expects
you
to
come
up
with
billion
dollar
merger
and
acquisition
deals
that
would
be
like
your
life
depending
on
it
these
people
are
weirdly
obsessed
with
video
games
do
not
take
-----
while
i
appreciate
the
professor's
enthusiasm
for
the
gaming
industry
i
am
concerned
that
he
does
not
take
a
student's
health
into
consideration
i
was
injured
on
campus
and
i
had
another
medical
diagnosis
where
the
er
doctor
told
me
no
activity
until
5
14
and
professor
joost
requested
the
final
paper
the
following
day
-----
he's
really
laid
back
and
fun
to
talk
to
but
i
really
didn't
learn
anything
in
his
class
definitely
not
waking
up
every
friday
morning
for
it's
an
easy
a
but
if
you're
looking
for
a
professor
to
give
you
in-depth
insight
into
the
mechanisms
of
the
video
game
industry
look
elsewhere
-----
soooooo
laidback
awesome
guy
very
understanding
young
many
connections
made
the
summer
course
very
fun
why
did
it
have
to
end

the
class
interesting
informative
and
fun
not
many
assignments
and
she
grades
very
easy
take
advantage
of
her
office
hours
if
you
have
questions
would
recommend
taking
her
politics
of
public
policy
class
for
anyone
who
is
looking
for
a
fun
but
educational
class

i
adore
professor
cruse
he
is
the
best
teacher
i've
ever
had
and
made
me
want
to
become
a
french
professor
he's
so
sweet
and
only
cares
about
the
success
of
his
students
his
lectures
and
readings
are
always
great
and
there
is
not
a
ton
of
work
at
all
this
is
a
class
that
you
will
want
to
go
to
and
will
genuinely
love
you
need
to
meet
him
-----
mark
cruse
is
amazing
he
knows
so
much****
it's
insane
i
don't
know
how
he
crams
so
much
information
into
his
brain
it's
really
impressive
but
at
the
end
of
the
class
you
feel
as
if
you
know
maybe
a
hundredth
of
what
he
knows
-
and
thus
brilliant
-----
very
clear
and
organized
knows
what
he
is
doing-
really
keeps
you
involved-
pretty
easy
grader
if
you
know
what
you're
doing-
you
do
have
to
study
good
guy-
i
recommend
him
-----
great
teacher
very
clear
class
and
explainations
no
surprises
on
tests
class
is
fun
not
too
boring
definitely
try
to
find
this
teacher
class
is
still
challenging
so
don't
expect
an
easy
a
-----
great
-----
ok
the
reviews
above
are
pretty
spiteful
but
in
all
honesty
he
just
seems
to
have
to
have
lost
his
connection
with
the
kids
the
class
simply
isnt
taught
he
lets
kids
speak
most
of
time
and
then
adds
filler
by
either
showing
clips
from
films
or
talking
about
the
2
textbooks
you
learn
little
to
nothing
about
screenplay
form
-----
ugh
what
an
****
i
hope
he
reads
this
and
shapes
up
be
nicer
to
the
kids
you
hate
and
maybe
theyll
do
better
work
for
you
creep
-----
totally
unprofessional
unclear
about
deadlines
terrible
teacher
he
left
zero
room
for
innovation
or
creativity
in
his
class;
he
kept
students
late
without
advance
warning;
when
he
didn't
like
you
as
a
person
he
shut
down
and
became
abrasive
rude
and
unavailable
-----
prof
rinaldi
is
such
a
great
italian
prof
i
always
struggled
with
languages
but
she
cleared
up
many
of
the
issues
i
had
with
grammar
she
is
a
native
italian
and
tells
many
stories
about
her
life
in
italy
and
actual
italian
culture
amazing
dedicated
and
sweet
professor
her
only
flaw
is
she
takes
a
long
time
to
get
into
the
groove
of
a
lesson
-----
prof
rinaldi
goes
out
of
her
way
to
make
the
class
interesting
and
fun
about
once
a
week
we
would
have
class
at
an
italian
cafe
or
playing
football
in
washington
square
she
is
an
interesting
person
and
her
experiences
add
to
the
interest
level
of
the
class
i
highly
recommnend
taking
her
-----
this
is
the
most
amazing
teacher
i've
ever
had
really
goes
out
of
her
way
for
her
students
one
of
the
few
teachers
that
actually
cares
about
her
students
keeps
class
very
interesting
-----
she
really
goes
out
of
her
way
to
make
sure
the
students
understand
the
material
she's
such
a
cool
person
and
more
foreign
language
teachers
should
be
like
her
-----
literally
one
of
the
most
kind
and
understanding
humans
but
also
just
a
fantastic
professor
she
gives
great
feedback
and
is
awesome
when
you're
developing
and
writing
your
papers
always
open
to
office
hours
too
overall
just
a
very
organized
intellectual
woman
who
will
really
help
you
improve
the
way
you
write
and
revise
-----

is
an
incredible
prof

will
grow
both
intellectually
and
as
a

-----
the
most
insightful
and
genuinely
intelligent
professor
i've
had
thus
far
i
think
that's
all
there
is
to
say
about
that

mrs

so
excited
to
study

before
i
hated

and
never
saw
it
as
a
future
mrs
greene
has
inspired
me
to
achieve
more
in
the
psych
field

note
she

-----
had
her
for
intro
to
psych
recitation

-----
taking
jamie
berthe's
class
defined
my
concentration
she
is
extremely
passionate
about
the
material
and
really
encourages
students
to
be
as
well
berthe
is
an
incredibly
thoughtful
professor
and
is
extremely
keen
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
she
is
also
kind
and
caring
i
learned
so
much
in
her
class
and
i
am
so
thankful
i
took
her
class
-----
i'm
an
mcc
major
and
her
class
is
what
really
got
me
into
my
field
like
insanely
excited
about
studying
and
learning
and
whatnot
she's
big
on
examples
and
she
tries
to
be
as
lively
as
she
can
even
during
the
more
technical
lectures
try
doing
most
of
the
readings
to
get
a
full
understanding
of
the
topic
they're
interesting
anyway
-----
very
enthusiastic
and
straightforward
lectures
are
interesting
and
she
is
very
helpful
-----
very
clear
on
what
she
expects
and
how
to
get
a
good
grade
do
the
readings
attend
class
take
notes
and
you
will
do
fine
tests
are
reasonable
and
jamie
is
great
-----
go
to
class
take
notes
with
pc
ask
questions
she
speaks
fast
so
online
note
taking
is
best
great
knows
her
stuff
alot
of
discussion
posts
to
do
on
black
board
pop
quizzes
are
there
dont
miss
class
-----
she's
amazing
-
would
recommend
anyone
to
take
her
class
she
really
cares
for
her
students
and
their
welfare
so
she's
really
flexible
with
deadlines
she's
also
super
knowledgeable
in
her
class
and
is
able
to
argue
any
side
of
the
debate
just
participate
and
do
the
work
the
best
you
can
and
she'll
understand
-----
great
teacher
very
easy
very
helpful
just
show
up
and
discuss
in
class
just
be
nice
and
you
will
do
well
-----
laurie
is
the
best
writing
teacher
i
had
no
interest
in
the
subject
matter
whatsoever
i
still
don't
but
her
class
was
amazing
she
really
works
with
each
student
to
improve
your
writing
keeps
discussion
lively
does
drafts
and
rewrites
for
every
essay
pretty
good
readings
i'd
definitely
recommend
her
-----
i
took
a
producing
class
with
prof
lechner
and
it
was
very
interesting
most
of
the
class
was
lecture
since
it
was
a
lot
of
explanation
of
what
movie
producers
do
but
we
did
have
some
guest
lecturers
throughout
and
a
group
project
where
we
pitched
a
film
idea
very
understanding
and
down
to
earth
prof
-----
took
his
business
of
producing
class
and
loved
it
very
up
to
date
on
the
business
and
has
very
engaging
lectures-
i
bore
easily
and
i
rarely
ever
get
distracted
during
his
class
hope
to
have
him
again
-----
jack
is
a
great
resource
as
a
working
producer
he
isn't
shy
about
sharing
documents
and
personal
experience
he
cares
for
his
students
and
genuinely
is
excited
about
this
industry
and
the
projects
he
is
currently
working
on
-----
jack's
a
great
lecturer
and
will
teach
you
a
lot
about
being
a
producer
his
class
really
isn't
very
hard
as
long
as
you
do
his
readings
and
the
readings
themselves
are
all
interesting
anyway
great
professor
-----
deanie
is
one
of
the
kindest
most
loving
professors
i've
ever
had
i
had
lab
with
her
and
she
made
us
all
feel
very
comfortable
when
sharing
personal
stories
and
doing
the
therapy
sessions
she
cares
about
her
students
-----
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
professors
class
was
always
engaging
and
she
made
each
discussion
personal
as
she
shared
her
own
experiences
and
allowed
us
to
do
the
same
the
textbook
isn't
used
much
but
it
definitely
is
insightful
and
will
prepare
you
for
class
discussion
if
you
get
the
chance
to
take
her
class
do
it
best
decision
i
made
-----
deanie
is
the
sweetest
teacher
ever
she
makes
class
super
fun
i
actually
loved
going
to
class
everyday
textbook
is
not
really
necessary
for
any
assignments
although
reading
it
is
helpful
to
contribute
to
class
discussions
-----
deanie
is
an
extremely
helpful
and
friendly
professor
while
it's
difficult
to
meet
with
her
outside
class
she
readily
sets
aside
time
for
students
when
given
a
heads
up
the
textbook
she
uses
is
unconventional
but
highly
useful
should
you
be
pursuing
a
counseling
career
she
has
experience
in
the
field
and
knows
her
stuff
-----
professor
hannah
is
an
interesting
guy
it
seems
like
he
has
had
a
lot
of
really
cool
and
important
jobs
like
working
for
joe
biden
for
example
the
lectures
are
a
little
heavy
and
dry
but
when
it
comes
to
exams
and
the
final
paper
he
is
very
clear
with
what
he
expects
and
not
a
tough
grader
-----
uncharismatic
so
his
lectures
can
get
a
little
boring
in
class
discussions
are
fairly
straightforward
so
participation
is
easy
readings
can
get
redundant
but
reading
through
them
before
the
tests
helps
a
bunch
changed
the
schedule
syllabus
too
many
times
similar
to
what
was
said
before
but
doesn't
hold
himself
accountable
for
lost
time
-----
not
in
terms
of
grading
policy
or
what
he
wants
in
tests
often
won't
be
held
accountable
for
mistakes
a
bit
pretentious
and
over
complicates
answers
still
very
knowledgable
-----
he's
super
smart
and
nice
and
definitely
knows
what
he's
talking
about
i
just
wish
the
class
was
a
little
more
discussion
based
relevant
rather
than
lecture
based
i
enjoyed
the
class
a
lot
but
feel
like
i
could
have
learned
more
if
he
took
the
class
out
of
the
textbook
more
-----
she
was
such
a
nice
lady
but
i
didn't
jibe
with
her
teaching
style
we
did
a
lot
of
reading
then
would
come
into
class
and
just
discuss
it
together
i
felt
like
i
didn't
learn
much
because
she
wasn't
teaching
at
all
was
all
just
discussion
she
was
an
unexpectedly
hard
essay
grader
but
midterm
was
very
easy
-----
she
is
so
nice
caring
and
well-prepared
love
her
readings
are
sometimes
boring
to
be
honest;
but
thats
basically
all
the
readings
in
cf
are
mythology
stuffs
and
she
already
gives
out
the
best
she
can
to
make
them
more
attractive
not
that
much
reading
but
tough
tough
tough
grader
for
papers
if
you
want
easy
a
don
take
her
-----
she's
nice
smart
and
organized
her
classes
are
interesting
and
generally
discussion
based
she's
super
reasonable
-
allows
up
to
3
excused
absences
and
will
generally
be
flexible
if
you
need
something
she's
not
big
on
tests
but
you
should
take
the
essays
seriously
because
they're
most
of
your
grade
really
great
class
would
recommend
-----
rockstar
presented
us
with
very
interesting
readings
that
i
would
not
have
found
otherwise
extremely
helpful
and
readily
available
to
talk
with
students
outside
of
class
-----
watching
him
unveil
his
mind
and
explain
his
complex
thought
process
on
the
board
is
fascinating
and
has
inspired
me
to
approach
mathematics
as
i
have
never
approached
it
before
professor
was
very
communicative
quick
to
answer
my
many
emails
always
willing
to
help
and
kind
which
was
very
reinforcing
during
a
very
rough
patch
in
my
life
-----
he
taught
my
honors
algebra
i
class
at
nyu
great
professor
nice
guy
obviously
knows
his
stuff
his
lecture
notes
was
great
in
light
of
the
otherwise
pretty
useless
textbook
available
in
office
hours
take
the
class
when
he
teaches
it
only
real
complaint
was
that
the
hw
was
really
too
easy
for
honors
he
could
afford
to
let
us
learn
more
-----
his
algebra
class
was
my
favorite
class
i
have
taken
in
nyu
he
posted
his
lecture
notes
online
which
was
good
enough
that
i
didn't
even
really
had
to
read
the
textbook
homework
was
a
little
bit
on
easier
side;
it
was
mostly
prove
this
fits
the
definition
also
seems
like
a
nice
person
highly
recommended
-----
i
took
zappa's
algebra
class
in
spring
2017one
of
the
best
experiences
i
have
had
at
nyu
he
was
very
friendly
explained
all
the
concepts
patiently
and
lucidly
and
was
very
accessible
in
office
hours
and
specific
about
what
we
should
study
or
review
he
empathized
with
us
that
reading
textbooks
was
dry
and
made
his
lectures
self-sufficient
-----
excellent
teacher
-----
my
favorite
teacher
at
nyu
he's
compassionate
enthusiastic
and
funny
i
will
always
remember
him
google
his
name
for
some
interesting
reads
i
was
blessed
to
have
him
for
adult
lab
as
well
as
elder
clinical
at
ny
downtown
i
think
i
did
more
in
that
one
clinical
than
all
the
others
combined
he
made
me
do
everything
and
i'm
grateful
-----
hands
down
the
best
not
a
single
negative
thing
to
say
-----
three
words:
can
you
imagine
lmao
he
is
an
interesting
character
really
funny
or
corny
depending
on
your
type
of
humor
he
is
very
smart
and
knows
his
stuff
and
you
will
definitely
learn
a
lot
from
him
wait
till
you
see
this
man
-----
emily
is
nice
and
caring
but
for
the
essays
it's
hard
to
know
what
she
likes
and
hopes
to
read
lectures
are
good
but
not
related
to
the
essays
-----
you
need
to
write
in
the
way
she
likes
in
order
to
get
a
good
grade
also
i
don't
like
the
way
she
teaches
she
treats
you
like
a
middle
school
student
which
makes
me
feel
stupid
-----
professor
emily
stone
clearly
has
her
own
outstanding
understanding
of
how
an
essay
should
be
structured
yet
whether
this
system
of
standards
is
truly
objective
or
valuable
is
debatable
apparently
stone
knows
that
all
her
students
are
idiots
that
she
has
to
pay
efforts
on
so
a
minimal
b
score
would
be
the
best
gift
she
could
give
-----
emily
was
very
friendly
but
she
can
be
a
tough
grader
be
ready
for
weekly
assignments
and
to
participate
in
class
the
worst
part
was
that
she
isn't
great
at
giving
feedback
on
drafts
of
essays
so
make
sure
that
you
ask
the
questions
you
want
answers
to
the
majority
of
your
grade
is
based
on
3
essays
that
you
write
so
keep
up
with
work
-----
peter
is
one
of
my
favorite
professors
at
nyu
he
is
kind
passionate
and
interesting
he
cares
about
his
students
both
in
class
and
in
life
though
sometimes
he
could
be
unclear
but
never
that
strict
on
grading
-
he
just
wants
people
to
do
things
they
care
about
i
do
not
know
why
there
are
so
many
negative
comments
here
i
enjoyed
his
class
-----
this
is
the
worst
professor
i
have
ever
had
period
there
are
no
guidelines
for
this
class
and
he
doesn't
do
anything
to
help
that
either
basically
a
meaningless
class
he
seems
to
have
personal
vendettas
against
certain
students
as
he
is
incredibly
rude
and
singles
them
out
in
class
while
he
lets
others
get
away
with
offensive
comments
avoid
-----
this
teacher
was
possibly
the
most
frustrating
and
confusing
i
have
ever
had
the
assignments
are
incredibly
unclear
on
the
website
when
i
asked
for
clarification
he
sent
me
the
same
link
i
asked
about
he
is
always
late
to
class
and
never
apologizes
and
is
overall
very
bleak
and
pessimistic
i
would
not
recommend
this
class
to
anyone
-----
peter
is
the
worst
professor
i've
had
at
nyu
the
class
i
took
had
no
guidelines
no
actual
syllabus
and
was
generally
useless
his
demeanor
is
exceedingly
negative
and
he
singles
out
students
with
no
justification
i
did
not
feel
motivated
to
participate
nor
did
i
feel
like
i
could
ask
questions
to
clarify
things
big
letdown
-----
1
he
gave
homework
exercise
during
the
lecture
and
you
dont
need
to
do
all
of
them
you
can
choose
the
exercise
by
yourself
however
the
homework
exercise
is
only
to
increase
your
final
score
so
do
not
afraid
of
doing
problems
wrong
2
final
is
extremely
easy
and
you
can
do
it
again
as
a
take-home
to
increase
your
final
grade
-----
unlike
many
star
mathematicians
professor
cappell
obviously
enjoys
teaching
undergraduates
he
has
a
knack
for
simplifying
complex
material
so
that
3rd4th
year
math
majors
can
understand
it
while
also
pushing
them
beyond
what
they
think
they
can
do
-
wo
overdoing
it
hw
is
assigned
but
he
stopped
collecting
it
&
is
very
generous
with
grades
-----
in
the
second
semester
prof
cappell
became
slightly
less
organized
than
in
the
first
probably
because
if
he
didn't
get
to
anything
in
the
first
semester
he
could
push
it
off
to
the
second
semester
but
he
no
longer
had
this
lifeline
nevertheless
he
still
remained
very
clear
and
gave
good
intuition
however
there
was
basically
no
homework
-----
prof
cappell
is
one
of
the
most
brilliant
lecturers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
having
as
a
teacher
although
he
makes
the
entire
lecture
up
on
the
spot
the
lecture
flows
incredibly
smoothly
and
one
can
just
sit
back
and
bask
in
the
amazing
clarity
that
is
sylvain
cappell
not
too
much
homework
was
given
to
reinforce
the
material
however
-----
first
of
all
she
does
not
give
1
guidelines
for
presentations
papers
etc
2
if
she's
against
of
certain
topic
of
presentations
she
criticizes
it
3
papers
were
way
too
long
and
doesn't
even
give
us
any
feedback
of
our
papers
5-7pages
single
spaced
and
presentations
does
not
even
post
any
grades
on
bb
and
posted
our
final
grade
in
2017
-----
no
comments
-----
easy
grader
really
available
really
fun
class
she
is
one
of
the
very
few
professors
that
kept
me
awake
in
class
-----
great
professorhe
is
very
demanding
and
really
pushes
you
to
learn
very
caring
and
helpful
but
the
student
must
work
hard
to
follow
the
course
-----
no
comments
-----
do
not
take
this
class
if
you're
a
beginner
this
is
the
kind
of
class
where
you
need
to
know
the
basics
if
not
you
will
barely
follow
carlos
is
not
helpful
and
prefers
to
speak
with
students
who
are
already
a
little
fluent
he
has
a
caustic
style
and
he
does
not
make
you
confortable
overall
i
am
disappointed
-----
fabio
is
an
incredible
professor
he
always
talks
about
interesting
things
in
class
and
is
never
boring
the
only
problem
is
that
he's
an
incredibly
harsh
grader
for
no
reason
-----
professor
parasecoli
is
as
well-read
as
he
is
kind
lectures
and
their
associated
topics
representations
of
food
in
the
media
are
very
compelling
grades
are
based
on
2
medium
papers
1
7-10
research
paper
a
presentation
and
participation
lots
of
work
for
a
2
credit
class
but
a
fair
grader
who
accepts
late
work
makes
it
a-okay
-----
fabio
is
one
of
the
most
friendly
approachable
helpful
teachers
i've
ever
had
along
with
being
one
of
the
smartest
to
the
point
that
it
frightens
his
students
he'd
never
admit
it
but
he
knows
pretty
much
everything
really
-----
valeria
is
simply
amazing
she
was
the
sweetest
smartest
ta
i've
ever
had
she
is
incredibly
understanding
and
helpful
in
all
circumstances
-----
really
nice
kind
of
hard
to
follow
at
times
due
to
the
speed
at
which
she
talks
but
very
willing
to
help
-----
she's
a
lot
of
fun
and
she
tries
her
best
to
help
you
with
everything
you
might
have
to
do
more
studying
of
grammar
on
your
own
bc
we
jump
around
a
lot
in
the
textbook
but
she's
very
fair
and
fun
to
learn
from
-----
i
had
professor
kopcke
for
the
freshman
seminar
agamemnon
to
alexander
he
was
really
helpful
took
a
genuine
interest
in
each
student's
progress
and
went
out
of
his
way
to
assist
in
research
he
is
extremely
knowledgeable
and
really
makes
the
subject
matter
clear
and
incredibly
interesting
-----
what
a
wonderful
compelling
and
passionate
class
the
readings
might
be
extensive
but
the
care
and
thought
the
professor
puts
in
his
class
makes
up
for
the
work
a
wonderful
introduction
to
a
wonderful
school
-----
his
class
is
philosophical
and
thought
provoking
really
about
the
art
-----
clear
patient
passionate
and
motivated
to
see
students
succeed
in
french
clever
woman
and
also
wrote
an
awesome
book
she
enjoys
helping
students
and
will
go
out
of
her
way
to
help
you
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
i've
had
very
passionate
and
helpful
-----
she's
an
awesome
teacher
her
class
rocked
my
world
-----
excellent
devoted
and
fair
professor
clearly
puts
in
a
lot
of
time
to
her
lectures
and
unlike
what
commenters
said
is
very
open
to
alternative
perspectives
this
is
not
an
easy
class
but
it's
very
worthwhile
also
she
looks
young
but
i
know
she's
taught
several
years
at
nyu
-----
grading
at
nyu
paris
is
done
whimsically
and
aggressively
in
order
to
maintain
the
appearance
of
a
serious
program
arbitrarily
limits
the
number
of
students
that
can
perform
well
grade
wise
despite
their
actual
academic
performance
she
is
not
yet
able
to
teach
effectively
and
certainly
incapable
or
unwilling
to
give
helpful
feedback
too
you
-----
disorganized
tries
but
lacks
the
experience
and
skills
to
adequately
teach
or
communicate
her
ideas
teaches
art
art
history
as
part
of
cf
but
has
no
understanding
of
how
to
look
at
art
or
teach
art
history
heavy
reading
load
which
is
rarely
discussed
not
open
to
other
ideas
even
with
convincing
evidence
should
be
okay
after
she's
matured
-----
avoid
this
teacher
-----
horrible
tests
seems
to
help
but
don't
really
help
suppose
to
be
a
elective
but
hardest
course
i
ever
did
because
it
was
boring
and
seemed
to
have
no
use
to
anything
-----
i
always
felt
like
i
came
away
from
the
class
knowing
something
new
and
useful
which
i
cant
honestly
say
for
every
class
ive
taken
in
the
mcc
department
-----
he
takes
attendance
and
the
two
tests
have
a
lot
of
information
but
if
you
semi-pay
attention
in
class
you'll
be
fine
there
is
a
also
research
paper
on
the
exams
you
have
to
write
an
essay
you
don't
have
to
read
the
articles
he
sends
to
do
well
this
class
is
basically
media
technology
through
the
ages
and
it's
pretty
interesting
-----
the
new
media
research
studio
is
awesome
yes
there
is
slightly
more
work
than
average
but
he
is
a
very
fair
grader
and
is
totally
clear
in
class
make
sure
you
do
the
readings
though
since
they're
what
make
up
the
entirety
of
the
midterm
and
final
you
learn
a
ton
of
cool
stuff
in
this
class
that
you're
not
going
to
find
in
any
other
classes
-----
don't
take
the
new
media
research
studio
class
i
think
he's
not
really
clear
enough
with
grading
guidelines
and
expects
more
than
anyone
expects
he
expects
nice
guy
and
knowledgable
but
definitely
still
finding
his
feet
as
a
teacher
he's
young
-----
i
took
his
basic
probability
and
enjoyed
it
the
textbook
is
like
an
encyclopedia
and
hard
to
read
but
his
class
made
things
much
easier
homework
can
be
difficult
but
after
some
hard
work
i
began
to
appreciate
it
for
i
learned
many
cool
tricks
i'm
not
sure
about
his
calc1
though
maybe
those
freshmen
are
not
used
to
college
math
classes
yet
-----
the
recitations
were
helpful
in
that
they
did
the
written
homework
for
you
the
quizzes
were
easy
and
definitely
manageable
because
they
were
the
same
as
the
written
homework
however
the
final
is
written
by
a
different
professor
and
our
class
was
in
no
way
prepared
for
what
hit
us
he's
a
nice
guy
but
his
teaching
skills
aren't
that
great
-----
nice
guy
super
easy
midterms
decently
easy
quizzes
in
lecture
he
goes
over
proofs
as
opposed
to
practical
applications
which
means
i
stopped
going
to
class
for
the
most
part
the
final
for
calc
i
at
nyu
is
really
difficult
but
you'll
be
fine
if
you
do
the
hw
and
study
a
bit
-----
she
knows
her
material
and
can
tell
if
you
do
the
readings
or
not
compared
to
other
professors
she
explained
how
to
read
journal
articles
understand
the
datacharts
and
pushed
students
to
learn
the
language
of
ir
very
helpful
for
those
from
a
diff
field
final
paper
at
the
end
makes
up
most
of
your
grade
not
too
tough
a
grader
-----
professor
tyler
has
certainly
shaped
my
understanding
of
the
world
and
it's
nice
that
even
when
we
are
discussing
tragedies
of
genocidal
proportions
she
can
still
work
in
some
deadpan
humor
take
her
class
-----
i
learned
a
lot
from
her
more
than
any
of
my
other
classes
combined
she
seemed
strict
at
first
but
after
she
gets
to
know
you
is
pretty
flexible
and
understanding
had
the
liveliest
discussions
in
her
class
vs
my
other
courses
-----
janos
is
basically
the
man
because
he
promotes
a
fun
learning
environment
that
is
actually
conducive
to
positive
learning
outcomes
take
his
class
if
you
get
the
chance
because
he's
very
understanding
about
deadlines
and
class
is
actually
enjoyable
-----
funny
smart
and
trs
trs
witty
classes
are
always
amusing
-----
awesome
prof
-----
i
really
enjoyed
prof
george
definitely
take
her
if
you
have
the
choice
she
provides
helpful
feedback
and
tailors
the
class
to
the
students'
abilities
she
is
also
the
head
of
the
undergrad
department
so
she
is
a
great
connection
to
have
your
final
grade
will
depend
on
personal
improvement
so
no
matter
your
level
you
can
do
well
-----
the
professor
is
mostly
nice
though
a
bit
stiff
but
the
class
itself
felt
outdated
and
often
boring
not
much
choice
in
the
program
but
other
classes
i've
taken
were
far
better
-----
undoubtedly
the
best
professor
i've
ever
had
and
the
best
class
i've
ever
taken
cares
about
her
students
like
they're
her
children
and
every
class
was
fun
engaging
and
educational
she's
a
once
in
a
college
career
type
of
professor
and
you'd
be
making
a
terrible
mistake
not
taking
her
class
regardless
of
what
it
is
-----
she
lectures
all
the
time
doesn't
appreciate
questions
she
doesn't
know
99%
is
graded
by
exams
which
are
not
difficult
if
you
read
some
and
go
to
class
there
is
no
material
more
updated
than
the
late
1970s
other
than
how
outdated
and
usa
specific
her
knowledge
is
the
class
covers
well
basic
criminology
theories
categories
and
policy
options
-----
professor
dixon
is
clearly
well-versed
in
criminology
and
her
class
is
informative
and
interesting
at
times
coming
to
class
will
help
you
get
a
b
or
b+
but
you
must
do
all
of
the
readings
to
get
an
a
and
having
over
100
dense
pages
for
one
class
a
week
is
not
generally
possible
i've
never
known
anyone
who
does
all
the
readings
just
most
-----
i
took
her
for
criminology
and
it
was
a
pretty
basic
class
the
whole
class
was
based
on
three
tests
based
solely
on
the
lectures
and
readings
don't
bother
buying
the
book
because
she
just
regurgitates
it
in
class
you
could
probably
get
a
b
without
doing
any
readings
and
just
showing
up
to
class
or
vice
versa
very
smart
and
reputable
woman
-----
lisa
might
not
be
the
best
lecturer
but
she
is
super
nice
in
person
attendance
is
not
mandatory
and
she
posts
all
the
materials
that
will
help
you
study
she
curves
every
single
one
of
her
exams
not
too
many
quizzes
and
the
homework
is
a
decent
amount
just
read
the
textbook
do
the
homework
and
practice
exams
you
will
be
all
set
-----
the
course
uses
r
studio
and
r
code
if
you
go
to
her
office
hours
she
will
literally
type
it
in
you
got
perfect
grades
when
she
did
it
for
me
no
one
really
goes
to
office
hrs
so
she
is
more
willing
to
help
when
you
do
go
lab
webassign
and
quiz
due
every
wk
my
ta
was
the
worst
she
drops
two
of
the
lowest
lab
grades
and
two
of
the
lowest
quiz
-----
lisa
is
nice
knowledgeable
about
the
subject
and
is
often
available
for
office
hours
however
she
comes
off
as
inexperienced
in
teaching
has
trouble
with
engaging
the
class
during
the
lectures
and
sometimes
made
the
material
very
confusing;
people
often
walked
out
also
the
r
coding
program
left
the
class
confused
and
didn't
help
us
much
-----
prof
mckeen
is
quite
the
hard
grader
he
also
assigns
a
lot
of
essays
throughout
the
semester
10
2-page
essays
3
4-page
essays
try
to
avoid
this
class
if
writing
is
not
something
you
enjoy
-----
professor
mckeen
is
a
good
professor
that
tries
to
make
the
material
somewhat
engaging
although
he
does
assign
a
lot
of
essays
throughout
the
semester
he
is
pretty
lenient
in
grading
them
-----
papers
do
not
have
set
due
dates
and
the
syllabus
in
general
does
not
have
a
great
structure
nice
professor
in
general
and
gives
good
feedback
the
10
response
papers
get
tedious
and
you
need
to
plan
the
other
essays
ahead
of
time
since
they
are
due
at
the
end
of
the
semester
-----
dr
coruzzi
is
really
passionate
about
plants
and
it
comes
through
in
her
lectures
her
lecture
pace
was
a
little
fast
but
the
slides
are
easily
accessible
and
cover
everything
you
need
to
know
for
the
exam
pob
ii
in
general
was
much
more
enjoyable
than
pob
i
and
i
recommend
it
-----
her
lectures
were
fine
and
i
didn't
find
the
information
to
be
boring
even
though
i'm
not
usually
one
for
plant
biology
test
questions
are
straightforward
and
relatively
easy
mostly
coming
from
the
homework
which
was
really
easy
make
sure
you
pay
attention
in
recitation
and
you'll
be
fine
for
this
portion
of
the
course
-----
she
really
likes
plants
more
than
you
probably
good
teacher
but
you
definitely
need
to
think
deeply
about
it
because
her
organization
is
a
little
weird
and
you
need
to
make
your
own
connectins
-----
muni
is
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
had
at
nyu
she's
extremely
knowledgeable
and
kind
and
she
makes
the
lectures
very
interesting
it
was
my
favorite
cams
class
as
long
as
you
participate
sometimes
and
make
an
effort
you'll
do
well
-----
this
course
was
by
far
the
best
i
have
taken
during
my
college
years
i
have
learned
so
much
professor
olia
is
smart
and
inspiring
i
want
to
be
her
this
class
is
very
likely
to
change
my
career
plans
in
the
future
but
i
think
it
could
be
helpful
for
any
student
at
nyu
as
it
truly
opens
your
eyes
to
the
world
-----
professor
olia
is
one
of
the
best
professors
i
have
had
at
nyu
her
class
global
perspectives
on
child
and
adolescent
mental
heath
is
a
must
take
for
anyone
interested
in
the
field
of
psychology
and
or
human
rights
you
will
definitely
grow
as
a
student
by
taking
this
class
you
will
get
out
of
it
what
you
put
into
it
-----
jeff
day
where
do
i
begin
this
man
has
changed
everything
for
me
he
has
completely
made
me
rethink
the
way
i
photograph
and
view
the
world
cares
about
his
students
and
gives
constructive
feedback
anticipates
what
you
need
before
you
even
know
you
need
it
he
is
a
powerful
man
-----
what
i
love
about
jeff
is
he's
not
interested
in
helping
you
fill
a
requirement
towards
a
diploma;
he's
interested
in
actually
teaching
you
skills
that
you
can
use
in
the
real
world
and
helping
you
grow
as
an
artist
you
get
back
what
you
put
into
the
class
so
to
reap
the
rewards
you
just
have
try
i
am
in
beyond
picture
perfect
as

me
such
a
better
photographer
i
definitely
recommend

prof
astrinaki
is
a
very
understanding
person
if
you
submit
something
late
once
or
have
trouble
with
an
assignment
but
she
will
call
you
out
in
class
if
you're
clearly
not
doing
what
she
asked
for
she
is
a
caring
person
who
wants
the
best
for
her
students
she
realizes
she
ask
for
a
lot
so
she
is
more
open
to
discussion
-----
she
is
lovely
and
always
willing
to
help
outside
of
class
the
class
is
extremely
interesting
and
not
that
difficult
she
is
very
knowledgeable
in
the
field
that
being
said
if
you
are
rude
in
class
go
on
your
phone
don't
pay
attention
don't
do
the
readings
she
will
call
you
out
on
it
which
i
felt
was
completely
valid
-----
awesome
and
sweet
lady
seminar
on
modern
greek
culture
was
a
very
interesting
class
i
got
to
look
at
all
forms
of
art
just
don't
forget
to
cite
sources
in
your
papers
-----
easily
one
of
the
most
passionate
knowledgable
caring
nyu
econ
professor
but
extremely
difficult
problem
sets
&
exams
which
are
the
only
graded
components
attendance
isn't
mandatory
but
lectures
are
crucial
to
understanding
the
seriously
math-heavy
material
this
class
is
def
meant
for
econ
theory
and
not
policy
so
take
the
class
to
learn
-----
prof
ray
is
extremely
intelligent
approachable
and
delightful
the
class
is
theory-
and
math-heavy
however
debraj
is
wonderful
at
explaining
the
concepts
and
makes
a
conscious
effort
to
answer
all
doubts
homework
and
exams
are
not
easy
and
require
some
serious
effort
i
learnt
a
lot
from
the
class
and
debraj
himself
a
wonderful
class
overall
-----
explains
very
well
is
engaging
and
accessible
but
has
tough
problem
sets
and
expects
you
to
work
in
order
to
learn
fair
grader
reasonable
tests
overall
the
best
econ
class
and
econ
prof
i've
had
at
nyu

great
professor
holds
you
to
high
high
standard
w
pronunciation
and
grammar
but
is
a
fair
grader
and
is
understanding
she's
a
brilliant
person
who
had
an
incredible
career
before
teaching
french
-----
hayet
is
the
best
french
instructor
i've
ever
had
if
you
are
looking
for
an
easy
a
sans
effort
do
not
take
her
class
if
you
are
looking
to
learn
french
-
to
actually
learn
french
-
enroll
with
her
right
away
not
only
is
she
an
expert
at
teaching
the
language
but
she
motivates
you
to
work
for
it
and
is
supportive
giving
patient
all
the
way
-----
the
worst
created
an
environment
where
people
were
afraid
to
speak
french
and
thats
like
the
worst
thing
possible
for
a
conversation
class
just
praying
i
passed
even
though
i
have
never
received
lower
than
at
95
in
a
french
class
in
my
life
-----
he
is
simply
awesome
provided
you
interact
with
him
in
the
class
and
do
your
homework
on
time
his
memory
power
is
great
he
can
remember
a
student
just
by
his
handwriting
if
you
want
to
work
hard
then
take
this
class
with
hard
work
i
learnt
a
great
deal
with
him
if
you
are
lazy
then
keep
away
this
is
not
the
class
for
you
-----
no
comments
-----
this
class
was
amazing
vida
brought
the
class
all
around
nyc
and
showed
us
amazing
things
interesting
discussions
in
class
mostly
field
trips
very
good
teacher
and
wonderful
and
kind
woman
-----
i
took
her
intro
to
galleries
and
museums
of
new
york
class
and
she
is
a
fantastic
woman
it
was
mostly
a
field
trip
class
so
attendance
was
pretty
important
on
those
days
but
homework
is
minimal
and
a
lot
of
reading
is
optional
as
long
as
you
show
genuine
interest
you'll
get
an
a
she's
very
sweet
with
a
hip
grandmother-y
vibe
-----
hertkorn
taught
my
peace
and
conflict
resolution
class
in
the
global
studies
program
i
found
her
to
be
intelligent
and
engaging
and
it
is
obvious
she
wants
her
students
to
succeed
i
enjoyed
appreciated
her
insight
so
much
that
i
asked
her
to
be
my
thesis
advisor
working
together
was
great
and
i
highly
recommend
her
as
a
professor
-----
no
comments
-----
i
love
professor
choi
he
is
soooo
cute
and
nice
his
class
was
hard
but
you
can
definitely
get
your
grade
up
if
you
try
i
would
definitely
recommend
him
-----
really
funny
and
entertaining
class
genuinely
wants
students
to
succeed
he
has
a
lot
of
experience;
not
good
if
you
want
to
learn
bookkeeping
but
he
really
teaches
you
how
to
analyze
financial
statements
-----
professor
guth
is
older
so
it
can
be
very
hard
to
pay
attention
during
the
first
half
of
the
semester
while
he
lectures
nonstop
the
big
isp
project
is
killer
but
that
is
the
case
no
matter
what
professor
he
was
extremely
nice
and
caring
to
all
his
students
but
those
readings
were
a
pain
-----
very
kind
and
funny
he
is
old
so
it's
hard
to
pay
attention
at
times
but
he's
a
fair
grader
and
he
seems
to
care
about
the
students
-----
great
great
great
teacher
learnt
so
much
she
is
very
motivating
i
love
her
style
totally
recommend
her
-----
you
will
learn
so
much
in
her
class
that
your
head
will
explode
the
lectures
are
awesome
but
she
pushes
you
to
do
great
work
you
may
be
stressed
out
during
the
semester
but
when
it's
all
over
you
will
be
twice
the
student
you
were
going
in
your
writing
will
improve
you
have
no
choice
class
was
outstanding
could
not
recommend
it
more
-----
alex
is
actually
a
really
great
teacher
and
an
easy
grader
the
midterm
is
pretty
difficult
but
he
grades
it
as
nicely
as
he
can
and
he
gives
less
quizzes
than
he
is
supposed
to
which
is
nice
he's
a
really
helpful
and
nice
guy
and
lets
us
out
early
all
the
time
-----
made
this
just
to
warn
everyone
he
is
horrible
do
not
take
him
you
can't
understand
what
he's
talking
about
and
if
he
makes
a
mistake
he
justifies
it
by
say
oh
i'm
not
good
at
math
then
please
stop
teaching
this
class
his
awful
teaching
brought
my
gpa
down
tremendously
there
isn't
a
single
person
i've
found
who
likes
him
just
avoid
this
-----
i
took
the
8
week
course
he
offered
for
2
credits
and
it
was
well
worth
it
we
never
met
as
a
class
since
everything
was
performed
online
more
or
less
at
our
own
pace
assignments
were
easy
and
short
but
they
made
you
think
and
interact
with
the
knowledge
you'd
collected;
which
is
perfect
i
strongly
recommend
taking
him
-----
intro
to
media
could
not
figure
out
what
kind
of
expectations
he
had
for
his
students
took
off
points
for
slightest
reasons
after
reaching
out
and
meeting
him
numerous
times
to
discuss
topics&
my
work
i
got
no
real
help
there
was
no
way
i
could
get
a
good
grade
seemed
like
he
was
predisposed
of
who
he
thought
i
was
and
gave
me
no
chance
-----
i
went
to
lectures
however
i
never
actually
reviewed
any
of
my
notes
she
basically
just
lectures
out
of
the
textbook
if
your
read
the
textbook
and
by
read
i
mean
outline
and
pay
very
close
attention
to
detail
you
will
be
fine
i
went
to
her
office
hours
to
clarify
a
couple
of
concepts
and
she
is
very
helpful
-----
i'll
give
her
credit
for
this
being
her
first
year
lecturing
her
exam
questions
tend
to
be
very
difficult
and
unlike
those
she
asks
in
class
the
textbook
helps
understand
a
lot
of
concepts
her
homework
takes
a
long
time
to
do
and
still
doesnt
prepare
you
well
enough
for
the
exams
she's
really
funny
though
and
seems
nice
just
really
hard
-----
great
professor
has
many
degrees
or
something
like
that
tests
are
focused
on
what
she
says
during
lectures
textbook
is
unnecessary
except
for
the
dri
values
on
the
front
cover
for
assignments
and
stuff
-----
had
her
for
nutrition
&
health
she's
a
very
nice
woman
knows
her
stuff
and
very
engaging
during
class
minimal
amount
of
assignments
several
quizzes
2
midterms
and
a
final
her
exams
are
very
specific
make
sure
to
study
both
slides
and
text
hated
her
grading
no
curves;
what
you
get
is
what
you
get
rarely
a
chance
for
extra
credit
study
-----
professor
lee
is
an
extremely
knowledgable
musician
her
willingness
to
help
her
students
is
reflected
on
her
students'
performances
many
of
my
peers
and
i
had
never
taken
music
theory
classes
prior
to
this
class
and
by
the
end
of
the
class
i
feel
like
we
all
had
a
firm
grasp
on
the
basics
of
music
theory
also
read
the
textbook
it
helps
-----
accent
is
tough
to
understand
at
times
but
yoon
ji
understands
and
cares
about
what
is
going
on
in
your
life
and
is
flexible
with
assignments
if
it
is
needed
-----
don't
take
her
class
-----
she
might
be
clear
about
what
she
wants
from
you
but
talking
to
her
is
really
stressful
and
depressing
regardless
of
what
you
talk
about
or
how
long
you
talk
after
talking
to
her
you'll
realize
that
she's
never
said
anything
positive
about
your
academic
performance
taking
her
class
and
having
to
talk
to
her
in
regular
basis
was
such
as
pain
-----
he's
a
great
guy
with
really
extensive
knowledge
on
asian
history
soft-spoken
but
when
you
listen
to
what
he
says
it's
very
interesting
i
learned
a
lot
in
this
class
he
gives
really
good
and
helpful
feedback
on
the
assignments
-----
the
guy
is
so
humble;
he
is
apparently
very
multilingual
and
i
mean
very
has
had
a
long
history
in
the
field
but
you
won't
know
because
he
keeps
a
bar
up
very
professional
friendly
and
easy-going
professor
would
take
his
other
classes
in
the
future
-----
frank
is
a
very
insightful
man
and
a
great
teacher
i
enjoyed
his
class
race
ethnicity
and
popular
media
so
much
we
went
on
field
trips
talked
about
current
race
sexuality
issues
in
america
read
interesting
texts
and
really
had
great
class
discussions
take
his
class
-
he's
awesome
-----
frank
is
a
super
awesome
professor
he
is
easy
going
intelligent
and
is
eager
for
his
students
to
learn
you
will
only
get
feedback
in
the
middle
and
end
of
the
semester
but
you
can
email
him
to
see
how
you
are
doing
the
work
isn't
too
heavy
but
he
assigns
a
lot
of
reading
no
textbooks
but
a
lot
of
books
and
articles
-----
he
is
the
best
-----
he
is
awesome
great
case
study
homework
easy
to
pass
-----
his
lectures
seem
to
go
on
for
ages
and
his
clarity
varies
from
lecture
to
lecture
he
clearly
knows
the
material
but
his
delivery
of
it
is
questionable
there
was
a
quiz
every
week
not
easy
but
not
too
difficult
he's
a
great
guy
but
not
the
professor
for
me
most
likely
will
not
take
a
class
with
him
again
-----
professor
trogdon
is
a
good
guy-
he's
readily
available
willing
to
help
and
clearly
knowledgeable
in
the
subject
however
his
exams
are
hard
averages
for
both
midterms
under
65
and
hw
nearly
impossible
without
the
internet
despite
this
he
gives
a
generous
curve
and
i
think
it
would
he
hard
to
not
to
pass
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
do
well
-----
the
professor
speaks
with
indian
accent
which
at
times
make
it
difficult
to
comprehend
as
a
student
you
should
have
prior
knowledge
of
the
topic
being
taught
once
the
professor
rapidly
goes
through
the
course
-work
he
will
expect
you
to
know
it
-----
he
seems
to
know
what
he
is
doing
very
well
but
he
is
having
a
hard
time
to
process
what's
in
his
brain
to
something
digestable
to
student
he
also
has
pretty
thick
indian
accent
but
i
didn't
mind
at
all
during
his
class
-----
one
of
the
best
professors
at
nyu
and
the
reason
why
i
stayed
in
my
major
she
is
so
sweet
humble
yet
has
so
much
experience
in
the
industry
both
as
an
artist
and
executive
definitely
take
her
class
she
will
make
you
love
music
publishing
-----
blakeman's
class
has
been
the
most
enjoyable
music
business
class
i've
had
she's
very
knowledgeable
about
the
industry
and
encourages
students
to
discuss
their
opinions
she's
very
open-minded
and
actually
listens
to
suggestions
the
class
itself
is
pretty
easy;
there's
a
lot
of
group
projects
though
-----
very
different
teaching
method
very
unstructured
doesn't
lecture
and
likes
to
let
the
conversation
go
where
it
wants
to
go
can
be
frustrating
at
times
but
is
also
nice
to
be
able
to
talk
about
what
you
need
to
talk
about
your
grade
comes
from
logs
you
write
to
her
at
the
end
of
each
class
not
anonymous
so
be
careful
and
a
final
paper
-----
professor
jo
is
very
knowledgeable
and
has
lots
of
clinical
experience
she
teaches
the
class
in
an
experiential
manner
as
opposed
to
boring
lectures
and
power
points
she
expects
everyone
to
participate
in
class
discussions
and
wants
everyone
to
do
well
lastly
she
gives
helpful
feedbacks
on
graded
papers
i
recommend
her
class
to
everyone
-----
frank
is
a
phenomenal
teacher
if
you
are
passionate
and
show
that
you
care
you'll
have
no
problem
getting
an
a
the
assignments
are
not
difficult
but
do
take
time
and
make
sure
to
turn
them
in
on
time
because
of
this
you
are
motivated
to
actually
do
the
work
and
get
excited
about
what
you
are
learning
-----
frank
is
an
amazing
teacher
and
is
very
helpful
if
you
have
any
problems
with
any
of
the
products
lateness
of
assignments
get
graded
on
a
lower
scale
if
you're
late
so
it's
definitely
in
your
best
interest
to
turn
your
work
on
time
to
get
a
good
grade
-----
bob
is
a
wonderful
man
and
has
really
great
guests
speakers
for
entertainment
and
media
industries
one
thing
that
was
a
little
frustrating
though
was
no
matter
how
much
or
how
little
work
i
seemed
to
put
in
i
would
also
get
a
b
and
he
even
admitted
on
the
first
day
of
class
that
only
20%
of
the
class
should
get
a's
other
than
that
solid
prof
-----
great
teacher
and
great
person
i
liked
this
class
because
he
brings
so
much
useful
industry
perspective
to
the
course
rather
than
having
studied
the
material
he's
actually
done
a
lot
of
it
and
has
incredible
guest
speakers
all
the
readings
are
short
and
practical
workload
is
easily
manageable
he'll
remember
your
name
and
respect
your
effort
-----
had
high
hopes
for
the
nlp
class
overall
good
and
learned
a
lot
however
lectures
are
mostly
prof
copying
formulas
from
lecture
note
to
whiteboard
which
isn't
helpful
final
exam
was
ridiculously
difficult
only
neural
network
math
homeworks
were
a
bit
disorganized
too
prof
is
very
busy
and
doesn't
seem
to
have
that
much
time
to
teach
anymore
-----
the
lecture
is
amazing
helps
you
really
understand
the
field
and
view
it
from
a
broad
perspective
-----
dara
is
a
great
professor
she
is
very
friendly
approachable
and
understanding
works
well
with
students
outside
of
class
too
the
classroom
atmosphere
as
a
whole
is
very
comfortable
you
do
share
your
writing
with
the
class
and
revise
other
peer's
work
as
well
but
it
is
not
intimidating
i
loved
this
class
and
i
wasn't
a
fan
of
writing
essay's
-----
i
really
enjoyed
having
professor
regaignon
she
is
very
friendly
and
is
always
responsive
especially
over
e-mail
it
can
be
difficult
to
vocalize
your
thoughts
in
english
classes
but
she
never
made
anyone's
comment
seem
unimportant
or
wrong
-----
professor
fewell
is
amazing
she
cares
about
her
students
and
will
touch
base
with
each
one
of
them
prior
to
each

very

best

not
crazy
but
you

really

excellent
teacher

the
absolute

is
life
changing

the
professor

very
knowledgeable
and
active

movements

social
change

justice
everyone
should
be
required
to
take
this
class

amazing

super
interesting
and

get

-----
i've
always
dreamed
of
learning
italian
but
this
woman
ruined
it
for
me
she
was
confusing
and
expected
us
all
to
be
geniuses
in
an
elementary
course
she'd
literally
give
you
100
words
and
quiz
you
on
them
the
next
day-
words
like
sparkling
orange
juice
if
you
take
this
plan
on
going
to
a
tutor
for
help
-----
great
class
easy
going
professor
that
keeps
the
class
interested
with
collaborative
learning
and
great
stories
relating
to
course
material
the
professor
is
extremely
knowledgable
about
the
subject
matter
a
must
take
class
-----
he
is
not
actually
a
professor
he
is
a
grad
student
and
has
really
no
idea
what
he
is
doing
i
was
looking
forward
to
taking
this
class
but
i
ended
up
learning
nothing
from
and
it
was
a
complete
waste
of
4
credits
lot's
of
$$
if
i
had
had
a
professor
that
had
ever
taught
before
in
his
her
life
i
know
i
would
have
loved
this
class
-----
one
of
my
favorite
classes
at
nyu
jennifer
was
fun
helpful
and
extremely
smart
which
made
every
class
enjoyable
i
wish
i
could
take
another
class
with
her
