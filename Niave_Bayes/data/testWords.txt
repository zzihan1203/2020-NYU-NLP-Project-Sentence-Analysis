I
saw
such
great
ratings
of
sana
here
and
took
the
course
.
Now
I
think
a
few
of
these
might
've
been
written
by
herself
b/c
she
's
not
as
nice
,
sort
of
condescending
at
office
hours
.
and
def
picks
favorites
.
she
really
loves
this
1boy
in
our
class
.
she
taught
us
arrays
like
the
last
two
days
of
class
and
expects
us
to
know
it
for
the
final
!
Crazyyyy

good
